== How Files Are Organized
Every topic for this help set is found in the `link:topics[topics]` folder. While this can make for a long list of files, this flat structure makes it easy to find files by name.

The best way to find the file you are looking for is to navigate to a page on the link:http://www.infragistics.com/help/{path}/[{name}] help and pull the file name from the page's URL. If for some reason you are not able to locate the file name in this repository, then you are likely seeking a shared topic and need to look in a shared repository.
