= Specifying the Cell Behavior on Cell-Click

In 2005 Volume 2, the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridoverride~cellclickaction.html[CellClickAction]"]  property was given another option called  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.cellclickaction.html[EditAndSelectText]"] . This option causes a cell to enter edit mode and select the text in the cell when that cell is clicked on. The other available options are shown in the following table.

|CellClickAction Enumerator|Description

|Default

|EditAndSelectText
|Puts the cell into edit mode and selects its text, if any. The following snapshots shows what a cell looks like after it's clicked. Notice how all of the cell's text is selected. This makes it easier for the user to enter a new value. Simply typing the new value will cause the current value to be deleted (since it's selected). The user is spared from having to select the existing value to delete it before entering the new value.

To use this option set the CellClickAction property on an UltraGridOverride object. You can specify this setting for all Bands in the grid by setting it on the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridlayout~override.html[Override]"]  property of the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridbase~displaylayout.html[DisplayLayout]"] . Alternatively, you can set this property on the Override property of any Band.
