= Validate a Range of Values

WinValidator™ can validate several different scenarios, one of which is a range of values. Using the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.rangecondition.html[RangeCondition]"]  object, you can test to see if a specific value is within the range by setting minimum and maximum values. When instantiating a new RangeCondition object, the third constructor allows you to supply both a minimum and maximum value as objects, as well as a Type object to define what type of objects the range will include. Once you have a RangeCondition object, you simply need to retrieve the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.validationsettings.html[ValidationSettings]"]  object for the control you are validating and set the RangeCondition to the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.validationsettings~condition.html[Condition]"]  property exposed by the ValidationSettings object.

The following code demonstrates how to create a RangeCondition object that tests whether an integer is higher than zero and lower than 255 (similar to a numeric editor for RGB values). This topic assumes that you have a WinValidator component and a WinNumericEditor™ control on your form.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
' Create a condition that fails validation if the value
' is less than 0 or greater than 255.
Dim rc As Infragistics.Win.RangeCondition = _
	New Infragistics.Win.RangeCondition(0, 255, GetType(Integer))
' Get the ValidationSettings object that determines 
' how the control will be validated.
Dim vs As Infragistics.Win.Misc.ValidationSettings = _
	Me.UltraValidator1.GetValidationSettings(Me.UltraNumericEditor1)
' Set the condition to the RangeCondition
vs.Condition = rc
----

*In C#:*

----
// Create a condition that fails validation if the value
// is less than 0 or greater than 255.
Infragistics.Win.RangeCondition rc =
	new Infragistics.Win.RangeCondition(0, 255, typeof(int));
// Get the ValidationSettings object that determines 
// how the control will be validated.
Infragistics.Win.Misc.ValidationSettings vs = 
	this.ultraValidator1.GetValidationSettings(this.ultraNumericEditor1);
// Set the condition to the RangeCondition
vs.Condition = rc;
