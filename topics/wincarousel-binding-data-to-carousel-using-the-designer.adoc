== Overview

=== Introduction

In this topic, you will learn how to configure the data source at design-time, which will be set for bind data to the  _UltraCarousel_   control using the control’s  _DataSource_   property.

[[_Ref397457617]]

=== Application Requirements

1. Install the  _Infragistics WinForms 2014 Volume 2_   or later version of the product.

2. Start with new Windows Forms application using Visual Studio 2010 or later version.

[[_Ref397457625]]

=== Configure the data source

1. Drag and drop the  _UltraCarousel_   control from the Visual Studio toolbox area onto the form, or if you decide to create the control in code, then you need to add the following assembly references:

* {ApiPlatform}Shared
* {ApiPlatform}Win.UltraWinCarousel
* {ApiPlatform}Win

2. Drag and drop the Infragistics  _UltraDataSource_   component from the toolbox area on to the form.

3. Use the smart tag of the  _UltraDataSource_   component and select “ _UltraDataSourceDesigner_  ” option, which opens the designer dialog.

4. Add a column in the  *DataColumns*  section by clicking the left-most icon in that section.

6. On  _UltraCarousel_   control, use the smart tag to drop down the control’s task list and set the “Data Source” property to the  _UltraDataSource_   object.

At this point the control will display the data collection, as the carousel items at design-time.

Run the application to verify the result.
