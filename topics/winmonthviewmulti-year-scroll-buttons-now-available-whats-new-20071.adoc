= Year Scroll Buttons Now Available

Before this release, WinMonthViewMulti™ only supported Month scrolling in the month header of the calendar. However, since you're already viewing entire months at a time, it may be convenient to be able to scroll through years as well. Now you can! With the new  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.ultramonthviewmultibase~yearscrollbuttonsvisible.html[YearScrollButtonsVisible]"]  property, you can display year scroll buttons directly beside the month scroll buttons. You can even change how many years are scrolled with the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.ultramonthviewmultibase~yearscrollchange.html[YearScrollChange]"]  property. These year scroll buttons also support all the ViewStyles such as OfficeXP or Office2007. And let's not forget the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.ultramonthviewmultibase~yearscrollbuttonappearance.html[YearScrollButtonAppearance]"]  object which makes it simple to style these buttons in AppStylist®.
