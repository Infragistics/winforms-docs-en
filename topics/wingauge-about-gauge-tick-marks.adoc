= About Gauge Tick Marks

You can add tick marks to your gauge to display the values of the gauge's scale. The TickMarks property has two attributes:

* Minor TickMarks
* Major TickMarks

You can configure both of them to display "ticks" at specific values. Major tick marks are usually larger than minor tick marks. They are configured to highlight every n^th^ value on the scale.

The following screen shot shows a Radial gauge with major tick marks display at every 5^th^ interval and minor tick marks displayed at every interval.
