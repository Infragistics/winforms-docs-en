= WinGanttViewPrintDocument Smart Tag

In Visual Studio, each Infragistics Windows Forms control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By simply selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WinGanttViewPrintDocument™ Smart Tag contains the name of the component, as well as the following sections:

Appearance -- Provides common tasks involving the appearance, look, and feel of the control.

Misc -- Provides various options that will enhance the overall look or performance of the control.

Serialization -- Provides quick access to properties used in the IPersistComponentSettings interface.
