= Style the Scrollbars of WinTree

In Infragistics Windows Forms 2006 Volume 2, you can now style the scrollbars in WinTree™ just like you would with WinScrollBar™. We added a  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintree.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratree~scrollbarlook.html[ScrollBarLook]"]  property to the WinTree that exposes several of the same objects as the WinScrollBar control. By setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinscrollbar.scrollbarlook~appearance.html[Appearance]"]  property of the ScrollBarLook property to an  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.appearance.html[Appearance]"]  object, you can style the entire scrollbar. Alternatively, if you need more control, you can set properties such as  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinscrollbar.scrollbarlook~buttonappearance.html[ButtonAppearance]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinscrollbar.scrollbarlook~thumbappearance.html[ThumbAppearance]"] , and  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinscrollbar.scrollbarlook~trackappearance.html[TrackAppearance]"] .

The following code will create an Appearance object, set a few of its properties to show a light blue, vertical gradient, and than apply that appearance to the WinTree's scrollbars.

' Create an appearance object
Dim app1 As New Infragistics.Win.Appearance()
' Set the properties of the first appearance object
app1.BackColor = Color.White
app1.BackColor2 = Color.LightBlue
app1.BackGradientStyle = GradientStyle.Vertical
app1.ThemedElementAlpha = Alpha.Transparent
' Set the appearance of the WinTree's scrollbar
Me.UltraTree1.ScrollBarLook.Appearance = app1

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win;
...
// Create an appearance object
Infragistics.Win.Appearance app1 = new Infragistics.Win.Appearance();
