= New "Used By" List

== We Added a "Used By" List to the Resources Tab in the Style Explorer

We already have a "Used By" list in our Role Editor to state which roles are used by which components. Now we've added a "Used By" list to state which Resources are used by which Roles. A Resource can be used by any state of any role, therefore, the "Used By" list will show a list of UI Roles that the Resource applies to and child nodes of specifically which state in the UI Role it applies to.
