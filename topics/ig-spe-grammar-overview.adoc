=== Grammar summary

The grammar definition represents the structure to which documents must conform if they are to be considered correct. The Infragistics Syntax Parsing Engine supports context-free grammars, which are characterized with the following four items:

* a set of terminal symbols, which are named textual elements
* a set of non-terminal symbols, which are named sequences of symbols
* a start symbol, which is the only non-terminal symbol which may exist at the root of the syntax tree
* a set of productions, each of which indicates one way a non-terminal symbol can represent a sequence of symbols. In this case, symbols are either terminal symbols, non-terminal symbols, or both.

The grammar is represented by the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.grammar.html[Grammar] class, defined in the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing_namespace.html[Infragistics.Documents.Parsing] namespace and as one would expect, there are properties on the grammar which relate directly or indirectly to all components of a context-free grammar:

* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.grammar~lexerstates.html[Grammar.LexerStates] – The collection of link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.lexerstate.html[LexerState] instances, which each have a Symbols collection, all of which collectively contain the terminal symbols of the grammar.
* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.grammar~nonterminalsymbols.html[Grammar.NonTerminalSymbols] – The collection of non-terminal symbols of the grammar.
* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.grammar~startsymbol.html[Grammar.StartSymbol] – The non-terminal symbol which exists in the `NonTerminalSymbols` collection and is the start symbol for the grammar.
* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.nonterminalsymbol~rule.html[NonTerminalSymbol.Rule] – The root of a syntax rule tree which defines all the productions that have this owning non-terminal symbol as their head symbol.
