== Methods and Properties Reference for Performing Transactions

[[_Ref321067130]]

=== Introduction

In some cases, you may want to unite several end-user operations into one entry that will be recorded in the undo/redo history. This can be achieved using the transactions in the Infragistics Undo/Redo Framework™.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
The Undo/Redo methods cannot be invoked while a transaction is open or an exception will be thrown.

=== Methods reference summary

The following table summarizes the purpose and functionality of the methods related with performing transactions.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Method|Description

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~starttransaction.html[StartTransaction]
|Creates and start a transaction. This is an `UndoManager` method and returns link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undotransaction_members.html[UndoTransaction] as a result. Once the transaction is started, any changes that are added to the `UndoManager` will be added to that transaction. 

Nested transactions can be created by invoking the `StartTransaction` method while a transaction is still in progress.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undotransaction~commit.html[Commit]
|Closes the transaction as well as any open nested transactions within it and the transaction is added to the undo/redo history. 

The `Commit` method can only be invoked while the transaction is still opened. Once the transaction is closed, its property `IsClosed` returns _T_ _rue_ and invoking the method results in an exception.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undotransaction~rollback.html[Rollback]
|Closes the transaction and reverses the actions that had happened up to that point while the transaction was open. 

The `Rollback` method can only be invoked while the transaction is still opened. Once the transaction is closed, its property `IsClosed` returns _True_ and invoking the method results in an exception.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~executeintransaction.html[ExecuteInTransaction]
|Executes a specified `Action` within a transaction. 

If an exception occurs while the transaction is in progress, the `Rollback` method is invoked. Otherwise, the `Commit` method is invoked.

|Property|Description

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~roottransaction.html[RootTransaction]
|Returns the current open root `UndoTransaction`. 

If there is no open transaction, the method returns _null_ .

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~currenttransaction.html[CurrentTransaction]
|Returns the current open leaf `UndoTransaction`.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~isperformingrollback.html[IsPerformingRollback]
|Returns a boolean value indicating if the `UndoManager` is performing a `Rollback` of an `UndoTransaction`.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undotransaction~isclosed.html[IsClosed]
|Returns a boolean value indicating if the transaction has been closed.
