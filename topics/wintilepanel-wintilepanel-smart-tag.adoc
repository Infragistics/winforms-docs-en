= WinTilePanel Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005/2008 (.NET Framework 2.0/3.5), each Infragistics Windows Forms control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By simply selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WinTilePanel™ Smart Tag contains the name of the component, as well as the following items:

*Add Tile:* Provides ability to add tiles to the UltraTilePanel control.

*Layout:* Offers properties that will determine where, how and how many Large Tiles are placed within UltraTilePanel.

See below for a description of the above mentioned items, as well as the item's corresponding property in the properties grid.
