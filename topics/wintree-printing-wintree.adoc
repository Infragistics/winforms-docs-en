== Overview

=== WinTree Printing Summary

=== Code Example

This code example requires a project with a  _WinTree_   control, if not, refer to link:wintree.html[WinTree] help documentation before continuing the  _WinTree_   for print preview or print configuration.

The following code example demonstrates the  _WinTree_   for print preview on a button click event.

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
using (var printDoc = new UltraTreePrintDocument())
{
    printDoc.Tree = _ultraTree1;
    using (var previewDialog = new UltraPrintPreviewDialog())
    {
        previewDialog.Document = printDoc;
        previewDialog.ShowDialog(this);
    }
}
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Using printDoc As UltraTreePrintDocument = New UltraTreePrintDocument()
printDoc.Tree = _ultraTree1
       Using previewDialog As UltraPrintPreviewDialog = New UltraPrintPreviewDialog()
             previewDialog.Document = printDoc
              previewDialog.ShowDialog(Me)
       End Using
End Using
----

Call the  _Print_   method of link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintree{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratreeprintdocument_members.html[UltraTreePrintDocument] instead of opening the print preview dialog for printing the  _WinTree_  .

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
using (UltraTreePrintDocument printDoc = new UltraTreePrintDocument())
{
    printDoc.Tree = ultraTree1;
    printDoc.Print();
}
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Using printDoc As New UltraTreePrintDocument()
      printDoc.Tree = ultraTree1
      printDoc.Print()
End Using
----
