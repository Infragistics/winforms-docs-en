= Infragistics Windows Forms Now Supports 64-bit Operating Systems

In the past, Infragistics Windows Forms has supported all Microsoft® 32-bit operating systems. With the arrival of Windows® Vista™ on the horizon, and the emergence of dual and quad-core processors supporting 64-bit operations, it was imperative that we give you the ability to support an even wider range of processors and operating systems.

We extended the supported range of operating systems to include Windows XP 64-bit, Windows Vista 64-bit, Windows Server 2003 64-bit, and any operating system functioning on the 64-bit .NET 2.0 architecture.
