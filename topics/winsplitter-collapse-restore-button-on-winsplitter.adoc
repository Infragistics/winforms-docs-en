= Collapse/Restore Button on WinSplitter

WinSplitter™ enables end users to click and drag on the splitter bar to resize controls on the form. You can also collapse and restore using the collapse/Restore button available on the WinSplitter.

The button user interface on the WinSplitter control can be hidden by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultrasplitter~collapseuitype.html[CollapseUIType]"]  property to None, either through code or the property window.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.ultraSplitter1.CollapseUIType = Infragistics.Win.Misc.CollapseUIType.None
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraSplitter1.CollapseUIType = Infragistics.Win.Misc.CollapseUIType.None;
----

The WinSplitter control can be collapsed so that the control docked before WinSplitter has an extent of 0 and is not visible at run time. This can be accomplished using the control’s Collapsed property.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.ultraSplitter1.Collapsed = True
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraSplitter1.Collapsed = true;
----
