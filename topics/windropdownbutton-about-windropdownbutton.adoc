* AutoSize -- Determines whether the button automatically sizes based on its contents.
* Windows XP Theme Support -- Render using XP Themes when run under Windows XP

* PressedAppearance - Additional appearance to control the display of the button when the button is depressed.
* ImageSize -- Control the size of the image displayed in the button.
* AcceptsFocus -- Prevent the button from receiving focus.
* ShowFocusRect -- Hide the focus rectangle that is displayed when the element has focus.
* UseMnemonic -- Determines whether a character preceded by an ampersand in the button's text is interpreted as a mnemonic character.
* WrapText -- Determines whether text will wrap when the element is not large enough to display the entire text.
* ShowOutline - Determines whether an extra border is rendered around the button when it is the default button for the form.
