= Setting Focus on a Cell for Editing

Sometimes you may want to force focus into a cell and put that cell into edit mode to indicate to a user that a value needs to be changed. This can be accomplished by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragrid~activecell.html[ActiveCell]"]  property of the grid, and then calling  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragrid~performaction.html[PerformAction]"]  to put the cell into Edit mode.

== To force focus on a cell and place the cell in Edit mode:

[start=1]
. Before you start writing any code, you should place using/imports directives in your code-behind so you don't need to always type out a member's fully qualified name.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid;
----

[start=2]
. You need a reference to the cell you want to set focus to. In this case, assume the cell is in the active row and is in a column called "CompanyName" You get a reference to the cell by using the Cells collection of the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridlayout~activerow.html[ActiveRow]"]  object.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Dim aCell As UltraGridCell
aCell = Me.UltraGrid1.ActiveRow.Cells("CompanyName")
----

*In C#:*

----
UltraGridCell aCell = this.ultraGrid1.ActiveRow.Cells["CompanyName"];
----

[start=3]
. Now that you have a reference to the cell, you can make it active by setting the ActiveCell of the grid.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.UltraGrid1.ActiveCell = aCell
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraGrid1.ActiveCell = aCell;
----

[start=4]
. At this point, you may need to set focus to the grid. This is only necessary if the grid does not already have focus.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.UltraGrid1.Focus()
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraGrid1.Focus();
----

[start=5]
. You can force the cell into edit mode by calling the PerformAction method.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.UltraGrid1.PerformAction(UltraGridAction.EnterEditMode, False, False)
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraGrid1.PerformAction(UltraGridAction.EnterEditMode, false, false);
----
