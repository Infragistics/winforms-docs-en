= 3D Point Chart

The 3D Point chart is based on our existing link:chart-scatter-chart.html[Scatter chart], which essentially shows the relationship between numeric values in distinct series of data, thus providing useful information for scientific and predictive analysis. The 3D Point chart goes a step beyond the Scatter chart by adding another dimension (z-axis) to the chart. This gives striking depth to the icons displayed in the chart.
