= Modified Method Signatures

In Infragistics Windows Forms 2006 Volume 2, several refinements were made to our controls in order to support Application Styling. Included in these refinements were several method signature changes. Below is a list of methods that were modified in this release.

== Infragistics.Win.UltraWinTabs.ICustomMdiTab

|The signature of this method was modified to also pass along the UIRole and ResolutionOrder that should be used during the resolution order. This was necessary so that the WinDockManager™ can use the appropriate role and resolution order from the WinTabbedMdiManager™.
