= Office 2007-Style Presets Available for Charts

The 2006 Volume 3 release introduces over a dozen Office 2007 presets to the WinChart™ control. With these new presets, you can instantly give your charts a professional and modern look and feel. Some presets affect the visual appearance of the chart, others affect the chart's behavior, while other presets affect both the look and behavior of your chart.

A Load Preset dialog box is available that lets you easily select and apply a preset to your chart.
