= Filling in Empty Rows

Fill out the remaining rows of a grid with empty rows. This is strictly a look-and-feel enhancement so that the end-user has a better looking grid. The Empty Rows feature lets you fill the blank area in the WinGrid™ after the last row with empty rows. These empty rows can not be activated. These rows are not UI-interactive.
