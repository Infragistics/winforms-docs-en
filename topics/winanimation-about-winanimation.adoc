= About WinAnimation

The WinAnimation™ control is a wrapper for the Microsoft Common Controls animation class. The control provides the ability to play an AVI file or one of several stock AVI files.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The WinAnimation control requires unmanaged code rights. If a form contains an instance of the element and the assembly does not have these rights, a security exception is generated by the .NET framework and the form will not be displayed.
