= Culture-Specific Formatting

This topic applies to the following WinEditor™ controls:

* WinCurrencyEditor™
* WinNumericEditor™
* WinDateTimeEditor™

When using the WinEditor controls, the need may arise to have the editors display in a culture that differs from the culture of the current machine's operating system. In these cases, the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.formatproviderpropertyeditor~formatprovider.html[FormatProvider]"]  property can prove very helpful. This property grants the developer the ability to set the element's format to be consistent with any culture detailed within the CultureInfo class.

The WinEditor controls (WinCurrencyEditor, WinNumericEditor and WinDateTimeEditor) contain a FormatProvider property which makes it possible to assign these elements a specific culture.

The following code will set the culture of the WinEditors to French (France).

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub Use_the_FormatProvider_Property_to_Manipulate_the_Cultures_Load( _
  ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
	Dim culture As New System.Globalization.CultureInfo("fr-FR")
	Me.UltraCurrencyEditor1.FormatProvider = culture
End Sub   
----

*In C#:*

----
private void Use_the_FormatProvider_Property_to_Manipulate_the_Cultures_Load( 
  object sender, 
  EventArgs e)
{
	System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("fr-FR");
	this.ultraCurrencyEditor1.FormatProvider = culture;
}   
----

The string parameter passed into the culture declaration can be modified to reflect numerous other cultures.
