=== Overview

The Syntax Parsing Engine performs a syntax analysis of the tokens produced by lexical analysis. The result of this analysis is a syntax tree representing the grammatical structure of the document. The syntax analysis is based on definitions of non-terminal symbols in the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.grammar~nonterminalsymbols.html[Grammar.NonTerminalSymbols] collection.
