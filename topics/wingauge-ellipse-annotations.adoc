= Ellipse Annotations

Ellipse annotations are ellipse-shaped objects with text placed inside them. You can use an ellipse annotation to display extra information on your gauge.

For example, if you created a Radial gauge to represent a fuel gauge, you could add annotations with the text set to "Full" and "Empty" at each end of the scale.

The following screen shot shows an example of a Radial gauge with an ellipse annotation.
