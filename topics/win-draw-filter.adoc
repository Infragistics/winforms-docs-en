= Draw Filter

An element's appearance can be easily controlled by setting various properties on Appearance objects exposed by PLF-based controls. However, occasionally a requirement comes along that isn't supported by the control. This is where a draw filter is invaluable.

All controls that are based on the PLF expose a very flexible, fine-grained drawing extensibility mechanism. To customize the drawing of one or more UIElements of a control, you need to implement the IUIElementDrawFilter interface on an object and set the DrawFilter property of the control to that object at runtime.

The IUIElementDrawFilter interface has the following two methods:

*  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.iuielementdrawfilter~getphasestofilter.html[GetPhasesToFilter]"]  -- this method is passed a UIElementDrawParams structure and returns a bit flag enumeration called DrawPhase. The passed in structure exposes a property that returns the element to be rendered as well as properties and methods to support rendering operations like Graphics, BackBrush, DrawBorders etc. The returned DrawPhase bit flag specify which phase(s) of the drawing operation to filter for this element (the DrawElement method described below will be called for each bit returned). The DrawPhase enumeration allows you to filter the drawing before or after each drawing operation of an element (e.g. theme, backcolor, image background, borders, foreground, image and/or child elements).
*  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.uielement~drawelement.html[DrawElement]"]  -- this method is passed the same UIElementDrawParams structure and a bit flag indicating which single draw phase is being performed. The method returns a boolean. If False is returned then the default drawing for that phase will be performed. If True is returned for a 'Before' phase then the default drawing for that phase will be skipped. Note: returning True for the BeforeDrawElement phase will cause all the other phases to be skipped (even if bits for those phases were returned by the call to GetPhasesToFilter). Also, if themes are active, returning True for the BeforeDrawTheme phase will skip all phases up to but not including the BeforeDrawChildElements phase. The BeforeDrawFocus phase is only called if the control has focus (or the forceDrawAsFocused parameter was set to True on the call to the Draw method) and the element's virtual DrawsFocusRect property returns True.

The following sample code illustrates how to modify the drawing of a row's cell area borders in the UltraGrid:

*In Visual Basic:*
