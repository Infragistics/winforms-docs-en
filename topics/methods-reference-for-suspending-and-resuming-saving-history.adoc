== Methods Reference for Suspending and Resuming Saving History

[[_Ref320867284]]

=== Introduction

The link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager_members.html[UndoManager] class exposes two methods - for suspending and for resuming saving in the undo/redo history.

You may want to suspend the saving process when data is initially loaded – then it is not needed to preserve the collection changes.

=== Methods reference summary

The following table summarizes the purpose and functionality of the `UndoManager` methods for suspending and resuming the recording of link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undounit_members.html[UndoUnit] instances in the history.

|Method|Description

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~resume.html[Resume]
|Resumes the recording of `UndoUnit` instances in the history. 

Each call to the `Suspend` method must have corresponding call to the `Resume` method so the saving is resumed.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~suspend.html[Suspend]
|Suspends the recording of `UndoUnit` instances in the history. 

Any calls to link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~addchange.html[AddChange] or the other helper methods for creating and saving UndoUnit instances will not affect the undo/redo history.
