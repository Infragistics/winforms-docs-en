= Changing StyleSets at Run Time

If you would like to give the end user a choice between different styles created in AppStylist®, you will need to change StyleSets. You can either change a StyleSet at design time or run time. To change a StyleSet at design time, use the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultracontrolbase~stylesetname.html[StyleSetName]"]  property of any Infragistics control that supports application styling. At run time, use the following code to change StyleSets.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.ultraMonthViewSingle.StyleSetName = "StyleSetBlue"
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraMonthViewSingle.StyleSetName = "StyleSetBlue";
----
