= Changing the Background Color of the SelectedRows

WinColorPicker™ consists of a drop-down list that allows the user to choose a color. When the drop-down list is shown you have the choice between the following three tabs to choose a color from.

* Custom
* Web
* System

A example use case, is where you want to allow your end user to specify a different color for the WinGrid's™ selected rows at run time. This can be useful for customers that need a greater contrast then what is supplied in your style. The following example code shows how this scenario could be implemented. The code assumes you have a data bound WinGrid called categoriesUltraGrid.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
We set the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultracontrolbase~useappstyling.html[UseAppStyling]"]  property to False off WinGrid, because if you are using Application Styling when the customer makes a selection, the setting will have no effect if UseAppStyling is True.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub UltraColorPicker1_ColorChanged(ByVal sender As Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles UltraColorPicker1.ColorChanged
	Me.categoriesUltraGrid.UseAppStyling = False
	Me.categoriesUltraGrid.DisplayLayout.Override.SelectedRowAppearance.BackColor = _
	  Me.UltraColorPicker1.Value
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

----
private void ultraColorPicker1_ColorChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	this.categoriesUltraGrid.UseAppStyling = false;
	this.categoriesUltraGrid.DisplayLayout.Override.SelectedRowAppearance.BackColor = 
	  (Color)this.ultraColorPicker1.Value;
}
----

If you implemented this code, when a new value is selected from WinColorPicker's drop-down list, all selected rows are changed automatically to reflect the new color choice. In addition, any future rows that are selected use the newly chosen color.
