= Displaying Data in an Alternate Card View

== Background

Not all data presents well with the normal grid view, where there are column headers and rows of cells. The WinGrid™ provides an alternate Card View where the column headers are placed of the left and the rows display as columns.

== Questions

* How can I display my column headers on the left with my row data displayed as columns?

== Solutions

Set the CardView property of the band to True and the column headers will display in a column on the left and the data rows will display as columns.

The code in the InitializeLayout event turns on the CardView option for Band 0.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub customersUltraGrid1_InitializeLayout(ByVal sender As Object, _
  ByVal e As Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.InitializeLayoutEventArgs) _
  Handles UltraGrid1.InitializeLayout
	' Set the grid with the caption "Card View" to have its band 
	' appear as card view
	e.Layout.Bands(0).CardView = True
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

----
private void customersUltraGrid1_InitializeLayout(object sender, 
  Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.InitializeLayoutEventArgs e)
{
	// Set the grid with the caption "Card View" to have its band 
	// appear as card view
	e.Layout.Bands[0].CardView = true;
}
----

== Review

This sample project shows compares the Normal view of data with the Card View, and shows how to set the band property to display in Card View.
