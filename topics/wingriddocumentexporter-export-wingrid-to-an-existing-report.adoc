= Export WinGrid to an Existing Report

Using the WinGridDocumentExporter™ component, you can export your WinGrid™ to a PDF or XML Paper Specification (XPS) document. This document, known as a Report while still in memory, can consist of several  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.section.isection.html[Sections]"] , all created at run time by the Infragistics Document Engine™. You can insert your WinGrid into a section of a Report as support material for the Report as a whole by calling the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.documentexport.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.documentexport.ultragriddocumentexporter~export.html[Export]"]  method off the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.documentexport.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.documentexport.ultragriddocumentexporter.html[UltraGridDocumentExporter]"]  object. The Export method contains five overloads; this topic discusses the third.

The third overload of the Export method accepts two parameters:

* the WinGrid to export (Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraGrid)
* the section of the Report to which WinGrid will be exported (Infragistics.Documents.Reports.Report.Section.ISection)

In order to insert your WinGrid into a report, you need to create the report, add a section to it, and publish the report. Once you've created the section, you can export WinGrid to it. This topic assumes that you have a data bound WinGrid and a WinGridDocumentExporter component on the form. For more information on binding WinGrid to a data source, see link:wingrid-binding-wingrid-to-a-flat-data-source-clr2.html[Bind WinGrid to a Flat Data Source].

The following code instantiates a Report object, creates a section in the report, exports WinGrid to that section, and finally publishes the report as a PDF document in your C:\Report folder.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
' Create a report
Dim report As New Infragistics.Documents.Reports.Report.Report()
' Add a section to the report
Dim section As ISection = report.AddSection()
' Export WinGrid to the section
Me.UltraGridDocumentExporter1.Export(Me.ultraGrid1, section)
' Create a PDF file from the report and
' name it "WinGrid_Report.pdf" 
report.Publish("C:\Report\WinGrid_Report.pdf", _
	Infragistics.Documents.Reports.Report.FileFormat.PDF)
----

*In C#:*

----
// Create a report
Infragistics.Documents.Reports.Report.Report report =
new Infragistics.Documents.Reports.Report.Report();
// Add a section to the report
ISection section = report.AddSection();
// Export WinGrid to the section
this.ultraGridDocumentExporter1.Export(this.ultraGrid1, section);
// Create a PDF file from the report and
// name it "WinGrid_Report.pdf" 
report.Publish("C:\\Report\\WinGrid_Report.pdf",
	Infragistics.Documents.Reports.Report.FileFormat.PDF);
