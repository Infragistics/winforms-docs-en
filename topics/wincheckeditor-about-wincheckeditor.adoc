= About WinCheckEditor

The WinCheckEditor™ control provides a check editor similar to the intrinsic checkbox provided by the .NET framework, with additional features such as:

* Appearance support -- Full Appearance support including alpha-blending, gradients, Image, etc. for Normal, Checked, Indeterminate, and HotTracking appearances.
* Item Appearance Support -- Each item in the control's Items collection has its own Appearance object.
* Automatic Text Wrapping -- MinColumnWidth and MaxColumnWidth properties cause text to be automatically wrapped in a multi-line fashion.
* Multiple Check Styles -- The WinCheckEditor can appear with a State Button or Custom style in addition to the traditional Check style.
