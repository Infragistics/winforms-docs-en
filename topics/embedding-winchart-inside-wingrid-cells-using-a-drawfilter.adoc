= Embedding WinChart inside WinGrid Cells using a Draw Filter

Sometimes displaying tabular Grid data can be greatly enhanced by also providing a Chart to show an entity’s trends. Achieving this kind of functionality with WinGrid™ and WinChart™ requires custom coding that requires a good understanding of the IUIElementDrawFilter interface as well as some creativity. The following series of topics describe the design and philosophy behind an example that does indeed achieve this functionality.
