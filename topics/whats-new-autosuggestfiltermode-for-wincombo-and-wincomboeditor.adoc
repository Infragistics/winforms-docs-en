= AutoSuggestFilterMode for WinCombo and WinComboEditor

The WinCombo™ and WinComboEditor™ control’s link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.autocompletemode.html[AutoCompleteMode] allows you to enable a suggested list of values as your end users type in the control’s text box . New in 2010 Volume 1, the link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.autosuggestfiltermode.html[AutoSuggestFilterMode] property has been added to WinCombo and WinComboEditor for the purpose of specifying, whether a ‘StartsWith’ or ‘Contains’ condition should be applied to the text that your end users type into the control’s editor. You can also use the new link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.valuelist~formatfiltereditems.html[FormatFilteredItems] property to highlight end-user typed text that matches within the suggested list of values. This property is set to True by default.
