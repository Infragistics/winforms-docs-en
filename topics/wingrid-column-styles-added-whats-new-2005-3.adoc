= Column Styles Added

The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~style.html[Style]"]  property of the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn.html[UltraGridColumn]"]  is for convenience. It lets you set the edit style of a column to one of the commonly used edit styles. This list does not include all the styles that are available. If a style is not listed in this enumeration, you can use the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~editor.html[Editor]"]  property along with other properties that the UltraGridColumn object exposes, like  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~minvalue.html[MinValue]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~minvalueexclusive.html[MinValueExclusive]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~maxvalueexclusive.html[MaxValueExclusive]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~maskinput.html[MaskInput]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~formatinfo.html[FormatInfo]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~format.html[Format]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~maxlength.html[MaxLength]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~regexpattern.html[RegexPattern]"]  etc... to accomplish the desired column style. Some styles set some of these properties to accomplish the desired behavior. For example the CurrencyPositive style sets the UltraGridColumn.Editor to Infragistics.Win.EditorWithMask instance and the MinValueExclusive to 0. Also you can set these properties to further refine the behavior of a column style. This is because these properties take precedence over the Style property.
