= Creating a Style Library from a Template

You can create a Style Library from scratch with vibrant colors and versatility in a matter of minutes with the New Style Library From Template dialog box. All you need to get started is a previously created Infragistics Style Library (.isl) file. Just pick a base color for each ColorCategory in the Style Library and you're done. You'll be producing Style Libraries like a 10-man graphic design team. Follow the simple procedure below for a step-by-step tutorial on creating a new Style Library from a template library.

. Once you have chosen a Template Style Library, a swatch will appear in the Set Colors section for each color category (created in the ColorCategory Manager) contained within the Style Library. Choose a color that best represents your idea of what the Style Library should look like. If you need help choosing colors, the Color Palette Helper can choose matching colors for you.
