The Infragistics Windows Forms toolkit is an extensive one, comprised of over 50 link:win-controls.html[controls and components]. These controls and components have been designed for you to deliver the most cutting-edge user interfaces in your Windows Forms applications.

Explore the link:win-developers-guide.html[Developer's Guide] section of the Windows Forms help to learn how you can take advantage of each of the various controls and components. For example, you can use link:wingrid.html[WinGrid]™, a control that lets you quickly create visually compelling data grids that you can bind to any data source; and you can work with the link:winschedule.html[WinSchedule]™ controls and components, which allow you to build common Microsoft® Outlook calendar views ( link:windayview.html[WinDayView]™, link:winweekview.html[WinWeekView]™, and link:winmonthviewmulti.html[WinMonthViewMulti]™).

In each Infragistics Windows Forms volume release, we add an essential set of link:whats-new.html[new features and enhancements] to our suite of Windows Forms controls and components to make sure that you are always equipped to meet your business needs.

Our Windows Forms toolset is built on the link:win-plf-overview.html[Presentation Layer Framework™ (PLF)]. This true framework ensures that you have a consistent development experience, which will ultimately lead to your end users having a consistent experience with the presentation layer of your Windows Forms application. The PLF ensures that once you learn a few of our Windows Forms controls, there will be minimal effort for you to learn the rest.

The Windows Forms controls and components also allow you to fully customize all aspects of their behavior and appearance through various link:styling-guide.html[styles and presets].

If you need to upgrade your existing Windows Forms project version to the latest release, there are quick and easy ways to do this (i.e., link:win-upgrading-a-project-to-infragistics-windows-forms-11-1-(and-above)-using-version-utility.html[using the Version Utility (via the Programs menu)], link:win-using-command-line.html[command-line program], and link:win-upgrading-a-project-manually.html[manually]).

When you're ready to deploy an application that uses our Windows Forms controls and components, there are various deployment options available to you (i.e., link:win-using-xcopy-deployment.html[XCOPY], the link:win-using-global-assembly-cache-gac-deployment.html[Global Assembly Cache], and link:win-using-no-touch-deployment.html[No-Touch]).
