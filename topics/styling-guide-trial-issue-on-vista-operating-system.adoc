= Trial Issue on Vista Operating System

If you have installed a trial version of the Infragistics product, you may receive a licensing error when you run the AppStylist for Windows Forms application on Windows® Vista™ with User Account Control (UAC) enabled. To work around this problem, you can do either of the following:

* Run AppStylist as an administrator (i.e., with elevated privileges)
* Run Microsoft Visual Studio® and place an instance of one of the Infragistics controls on the form designer to initiate the trial period
