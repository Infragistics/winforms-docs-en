= Rendering GDI Text with TextRenderer

In .NET Framework 2.0, Microsoft implemented a new TextRenderer class to render GDI text. Microsoft's in-box controls use this class to render text on their own controls. Infragistics controls and components running on .NET Framework 2.0 still use GDI+ by default to render text. We have found that our controls (especially the WinGrid) render text much quicker using GDI+.

You can still render GDI text using the TextRenderer class. Setting the UseGDIPlusTextRendering property of the Infragistics.Win.DrawUtility class to False will disable GDI+ rendering. However, if text needs to be rotated vertically or printed, it still must be rendered with GDI+.
