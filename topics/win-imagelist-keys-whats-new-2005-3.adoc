= ImageList Keys

Visual Studio 2005 (.NET Framework 2.0) can assign a string name to an item in an ImageList. The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.appearance~image.html[Image]"]  property of the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.appearance.html[Appearance]"]  object was changed so it can now be set to the key of an image in the associated ImageList. Previously, the image could only be set to an image or an integer denoting the index of the image in the ImageList's Images collection.
