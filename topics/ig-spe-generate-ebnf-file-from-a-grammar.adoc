== Process Overview

=== Overview

You can create an EBNF file from a Grammar instance using the following methods of the Grammar class:

* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.grammar~saveebnf(ebnfserializationsettings).html[Grammar.SaveEbnf] - Obtain EBNF as string
* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.grammar~saveebnf(stream,encoding,ebnfserializationsettings).html[Grammar.SaveEbnf] - Save EBNF to a stream

Both methods accept an argument of type link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.ebnfserializationsettings.html[EbnfSerializationSettings] with the following properties:
