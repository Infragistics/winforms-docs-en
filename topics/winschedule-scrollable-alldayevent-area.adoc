== Enabling  _AllDayEvent_  Area Scrolling

[[_Ref342310379]]

=== Introduction and preview

Earlier versions (prior to 13.1) of the  _UltraDayView_   control did not support scrolling within the link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.appointment~alldayevent.html[AllDayEvent] area and imposed a 16-event limit.

By default, the  _UltraDayView_   control will continue displaying the all-day event area as it appeared in previous versions without a scrollbar or scroll buttons.

This feature allows you to set the  _UltraDayView_   control’s properties to enable the scroll buttons and scrollbars in the link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.appointment~alldayevent.html[AllDayEvent] area without limitations.

The following preview illustrates all-day events with scrollbar and scroll buttons enabled.

In addition to scrolling capability, the  _UltraDayView_   control introduces the new link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.ultradayview~alldayeventareapreferredmaxheight.html[AllDayEventAreaPreferredMaxHeight] property allowing you to control the link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.appointment~alldayevent.html[AllDayEvent] area’s vertical size. By default, size is 0 (Integer value), which informs the control to calculate the view’s optimum size.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
Enabling scrolling while the `AllDayEventAreaPreferredMaxHeight=0`, the all-day event area occupies as much space as it needs to display all events for the currently visible days, but will not exceed  *one-half*  the control’s height as illustrated in the following table.
