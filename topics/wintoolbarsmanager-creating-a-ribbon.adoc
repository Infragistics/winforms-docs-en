= Creating a Ribbon

{Warning}

== Before You Begin

Developers already familiar with WinToolbarsManager's™ object model will discover that the Ribbon isn't all that different. WinToolbarsManager has a collection of  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.toolscollection.html[Tools]"]  inside a collection of  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.toolbarscollection.html[Toolbars]"] . The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ribbon.html[Ribbon]"]  adds just one level to that structure. The Ribbon has a collection of Tools, inside a collection of  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ribbongroupcollection.html[Groups]"] , inside a collection of  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ribbontabcollection.html[Tabs]"] . This extra level of functionality gives you the detailed organization that your applications require.

== What You Will Accomplish

This walkthrough will guide you through the steps to create a Ribbon at design time. Creating a Ribbon will involve creating a  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ribbontab.html[RibbonTab]"] , a  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ribbongroup.html[RibbonGroup]"]  inside that tab, and some tools inside that group.

[start=6]
. *Run the application.*

When you run the application, you will see something very similar to what you saw at design time. The Ribbon designer is very simple to work with. It even allows you to convert an existing toolbar into a Ribbon with ease.
