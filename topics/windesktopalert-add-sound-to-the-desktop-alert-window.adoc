= Add Sound to the Desktop Alert Window

Another way in which WinDesktopAlert™ can capture your end user's attention is by using their auditory senses. Each desktop alert window can play a sound (such as the Windows® XP exclamation sound) when the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalert~show.html[Show]"]  method is called. You can have the alert window play a sound by creating an instance of the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalertshowwindowinfo.html[UltraDesktopAlertShowWindowInfo]"]  class and then setting its  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalertshowwindowinfo~sound.html[Sound]"]  property to a string representing the path to the sound. Once you have set the Sound property, you can call the Show method off the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalert.html[UltraDesktopAlert]"]  class and pass in the UltraDesktopAlertShowWindowInfo object as the parameter.

Use the following code to add sound to your desktop alert window. This code will instantiate an UltraDesktopAlertShowWindowInfo and set its Sound property to a local WAV file. The Show method is then called and the UltraDesktopAlertShowWindowInfo object is passed as its parameter.Before you start writing any code, you should place using/imports directives in your code-behind so you don't need to always type out a member's fully qualified name.
