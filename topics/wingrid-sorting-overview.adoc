= Sorting Overview

== Background

WinGrid™ can allow the user to sort on both single and multiple columns by clicking on the column headers. The developer can also instruct UltraWinGrid to sort on a column.

== Questions

* How do I instruct UltraWinGrid to allow the user to sort when the user clicks on a column header?
* The data retrieved from the database is not sorted in the order I would like for it to display in UltraWinGrid. How do I tell UltraWinGrid to sort on a column with code?

== Solutions

Instruct UltraWinGrid to allow user sorting by setting the .HeaderClickAction property to either .SortSingle or .SortMulti.

Instruct UltraWinGrid to sort on a particular column with code by setting the Column.SortIndicator to Descending.

== Sample Project

This sample project displays a multi-band grid configured to sort when the user clicks on the various column headers. It also provides a button which causes the grid to sort on band 1 column 3.

Before you start writing any code, you should place using/imports directives in your code-behind so you don't need to always type out a member's fully qualified name.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid;
----

The UltraWinGrid Events Region contains the following event handlers:

* UltraGrid1.InitializeLayout - The code in the InitializeLayout event sets the default HeaderClickAction for all bands and all columns:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub UltraGrid1_InitializeLayout(ByVal sender As Object, _
  ByVal e As Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.InitializeLayoutEventArgs) _
  Handles UltraGrid1.InitializeLayout
  	e.Layout.Override.HeaderClickAction = HeaderClickAction.SortSingle
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

----
private void ultraGrid1_InitializeLayout(object sender, 
  Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.InitializeLayoutEventArgs e)
{
	e.Layout.Override.HeaderClickAction = HeaderClickAction.SortSingle;
}
----

Button Events

* Button1.Click - The code in the Button Click event instructs the UltraWinGrid to sort on band 1 column 2 in Descending order:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub btnSortBand1Column2_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnSortBand1Column3.Click
	Me.UltraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Bands(1).Columns(2).SortIndicator = _
	  SortIndicator.Descending
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

----
private void btnSortBand1Column2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	this.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Bands[1].Columns[2].SortIndicator = 
	  SortIndicator.Descending;
}
----

== Review

This sample program illustrates the property settings used to allow the user to sort column data when clicking on the column headers, and how to sort on a specified column using code.
