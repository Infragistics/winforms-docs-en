= More Time-Scale Axis Support

If your chart contains data that you want to arrange chronologically by date, you can take advantage of WinChart's™ support for the time-scale axis. Even if your chart data is not in chronological order, the WinChart control can use the time-scale axis to organize the data chronologically.

In previous Infragistics Windows Forms volume releases, the time-scale axis feature was supported only by the link:chart-working-with-step-area-chart-data.html[Step Area], link:chart-working-with-step-line-chart-data.html[Step Line], and link:chart-working-with-gantt-chart-data.html[Gantt] charts. In the 2006 Volume 1 release, the following additional chart controls now support this useful feature:

* link:chart-working-with-2d-area-chart-data.html[Area Chart (2D)]
* link:chart-working-with-3d-area-chart-data.html[Area Chart (3D)]
* link:chart-working-with-2d-line-chart-data.html[Line Chart (2D)]
* link:chart-working-with-3d-line-chart-data.html[Line Chart (3D)]
* link:chart-working-with-scatter-line-chart-data.html[Scatter Line Chart]
* link:chart-working-with-2d-spline-chart-data.html[Spline Chart]
* link:chart-working-with-stacked-area-chart-data.html[Stacked Area Chart]
* link:chart-working-with-stacked-line-chart-data.html[Stacked Line Chart]
* link:chart-working-with-stacked-spline-area-chart data.html[Stacked Spline Area Chart]
* link:chart-working-with-stacked-spline-chart-data.html[Stacked Spline Chart]

Rather than evenly spacing the points across the X-axis, charts that use the time-scale axis plot values across the X-axis according to the elapsed time. This allows the end user to interpret time-based data more accurately.

Below is a screenshot of a line chart using a standard X-axis. Notice that the plotted points are evenly spaced across the X-axis.
