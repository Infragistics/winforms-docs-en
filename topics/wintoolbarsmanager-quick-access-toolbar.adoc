= Quick Access Toolbar

{Warning}

The Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) is a toolbar that is always visible so the end user can quickly click more frequently used tools. By clicking the drop-down arrow on the right side of the QAT, the end user has the option to display the QAT below the Ribbon as well. You can also set this feature yourself by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.quickaccesstoolbar~location.html[Location]"]  property to AboveRibbon (default) or BelowRibbon.
