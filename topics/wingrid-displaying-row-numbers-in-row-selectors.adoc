= Displaying Row Numbers in Row Selectors

You can easily display row numbers in the row selectors of the WinGrid™ using the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridoverride~rowselectornumberstyle.html[RowSelectorNumberStyle]"]  property.

This property has four settings:

* *None* - No row numbers are displayed. This is the default setting.
* *ListIndex* - This is the index associated with  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridrow~listindex.html[ListIndex]"]  property. These row numbers represent the index of a row in the data source.
* *RowIndex* - This is the index associated with the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridrow~index.html[Index]"]  property. These row numbers represent the index of a row in its parent's row collection.
* *VisibleIndex* - This is the index associated with  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridrow~visibleindex.html[VisibleIndex]"]  property. These row numbers represent a row's visible index in its parent's row collection.

*Note:* Make sure that you have  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridoverride~rowselectors.html[RowSelectors]"]  set to "true" when using row numbers.

== To access the RowSelectorNumberStyle property:

[start=1]
. Right-click on the WinGrid at design time, and select UltraWinGrid Designer.
[start=2]
. In the designer on the right-hand side, select the option called "Control Settings".
[start=3]
. Scroll down and expand the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridbase~displaylayout.html[DisplayLayout]"]  property.
[start=4]
. Scroll down to the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridlayout~override.html[Override]"]  property and expand it.
[start=5]
. In the Override property, scroll down to the RowSelectorNumberStyle property.

For example, if you set this property to RowIndex, the WinGrid will appear similar to the following image:
