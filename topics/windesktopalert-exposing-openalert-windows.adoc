== Expose Open Windows Overview

[[_Ref341518673]]

=== Introduction

Earlier version the  _UltraDesktopAlert_   did not expose the open windows collection requiring you to invoke the `IsOpen` method passing a Key or previously stored instance of an link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalertwindowinfo_members.html[UltraDesktopAlertWindowInfo] in order to traverse the open windows.

The newly enhanced feature, presented here, makes it much easier to query the collection of open windows using the link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalert~openwindows.html[OpenWindows] property exposes a read-only version of the collection that internally tracks open windows.

Users can traverse the collection of each link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalertwindowinfo_members.html[UltraDesktopAlertWindowInfo] object currently displayed and retrieve the count of the collection through the `ReadOnlyCollection` object; returned by the link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalert~openwindows.html[OpenWindows] property.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
Adding new windows to the collection and displaying the windows within the collection requires you to use the previously defined architecture.

=== Code Illustration

The following IDE screenshot shows a code example, triggered by a button-click event for retrieving the count of open alert windows from the link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalert~openwindows.html[OpenWindows] collection. Other properties and methods are also available as shown in the IntelliSense drop-down.

The open windows collection works best when paired with the link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalert~autoclose.html[AutoClose] property set to  _false,_   and the link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultradesktopalert~multiplewindowdisplaystyle.html[MultipleWindowDisplayStyle] set to anything other than  _Default_   or  _None_  , otherwise it will always contain one alert window, for example:

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
ultraDesktopAlert1.AutoClose = Infragistics.Win.DefaultableBoolean.False;
ultraDesktopAlert1.MultipleWindowDisplayStyle = MultipleWindowDisplayStyle.Tiled;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
ultraDesktopAlert1.AutoClose = Infragistics.Win.DefaultableBoolean.[False]
ultraDesktopAlert1.MultipleWindowDisplayStyle = MultipleWindowDisplayStyle.Tiled
----
