= Shadow Effects

You can apply various effects to the properties of your gauge. Shadow effects add depth and visually enhance your properties. For example, you can apply a drop shadow effect to an anchor to give it a 3D appearance.

The following screen shot shows an example of a Linear gauge with effects applied to the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.lineargaugescale~markers.html[Markers]"]  property.
