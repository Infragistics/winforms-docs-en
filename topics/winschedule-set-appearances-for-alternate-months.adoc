= Set Appearances for Alternate Months

This topic applies to the following WinSchedule™ controls:

* WinMonthViewMulti™
* WinCalendarCombo™

The WinMonthViewMulti and WinCalendarCombo elements can utilize a different appearance for alternate months. The following code demonstrates how to set an appearance property in the WinCalendarLook and have the elements use that appearance when alternate months are displayed.

In Visual Basic:

[source,vb]
----
Private Sub Set_Appearances_for_Alternate_Months_Load( _
  ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _
  Handles MyBase.Load
        Me.UltraMonthViewMulti1.CalendarLook = Me.UltraCalendarLook1
        Me.UltraCalendarCombo1.CalendarLook = Me.UltraCalendarLook1

        Me.UltraMonthViewMulti1.UseAlternateMonthAppearances = True
        Me.UltraCalendarCombo1.UseAlternateMonthAppearances = True
        Me.UltraCalendarLook1.AlternateMonthAppearance.BackColor = Color.Yellow
End Sub    
----

In C#:

[source,csharp]
----
private void Set_Appearances_for_Alternate_Months_Load( 
  object sender, EventArgs e)
{
        this.ultraMonthViewMulti1.CalendarLook = this.ultraCalendarLook1;
        this.ultraCalendarCombo1.CalendarLook = this.ultraCalendarLook1;

        this.ultraMonthViewMulti1.UseAlternateMonthAppearances = true;
        this.ultraCalendarCombo1.UseAlternateMonthAppearances = true;
        this.ultraCalendarLook1.AlternateMonthAppearance.BackColor = Color.Yellow;
}
