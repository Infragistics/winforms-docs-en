= Hide Toolbars

The toolbars in the WinToolbarsManager™ component can be hidden at design-time by right clicking on the element in the component tray and selecting "Hide ToolBars," or by right-clicking on the toolbars on the form and selecting "Hide ToolBars." The element will not be visible on the form at design-time but will be visible when the application is run. To make hidden toolbars visible at design-time, right-click on UltraToolBarsManager in the component tray and select "Hide ToolBars" again so the option will be toggled and the toolbars will no longer be hidden.

All of the toolbars in the WinToolbarsManager control can be hidden at design-time but remain visible at run-time, or a specific toolbar can be hidden. The second option is only accessible for toolbars and not for menu-bars.

A specific toolbar can be hidden by setting its  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintoolbars.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.sharedprops~visible.html[Visible]"]  property to False. It can be made visible again by setting its Visible property to True.
