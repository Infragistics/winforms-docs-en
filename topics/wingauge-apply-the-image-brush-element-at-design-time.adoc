= Apply the Image Brush Element at Design Time

Applying the Image Fill brush element to a property of your gauge renders the property as an image. For example, if you created a Radial gauge, and want the background to be your company's logo you can set the *Dial* property as the Image brush element.

*To apply the Image Fill brush element to a property of your gauge at design time:*

[start=1]
. Add a Radial Gauge to the Gauges collection.
[start=2]
. In the left-hand pane of the Gauges collection editor, click Radial Gauge.
[start=3]
. Expand the   pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgauge~dial.html[Dial]"]  property.
[start=4]
. From the   pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gauge~brushelement.html[BrushElement]"]  drop-down list, select Image Fill. This will create a new Image Fill brush element.
[start=5]
. Click the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.imagebrushelement.html[Image]"]  property, then click the ellipsis button (...).
[start=6]
. Using the Select Resource dialog box, import the image that you want to use to fill the selected property.
