= Improved Accessibility Support

According to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, all government applications must conform to a set of simple standards to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Most of our Windows Forms controls have been accessible for several releases now.

WinListView and WinWeekView are now joining the rest of our controls as completely accessible. These controls now have an AccessibilityObject which will allow you to give your end users any accessibility support they need.
