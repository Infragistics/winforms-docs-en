= Row-Auto-Sizing in RowLayout

Specifies the how the WinGrid™ calculates the default row heights and also specifies whether the user is allowed to resize the rows. Please consult the existing help document for more information on each  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.rowsizing.html[RowSizing]"]  mode.

This is an existing property. Infragistics Windows Forms 2005 Volume 2 and older versions did not support RowSizing modes of AutoFixed and AutoFree and Free in Row-Layout mode. This feature request is for supporting those modes when Row-Layout functionality is being used. Infragistics Windows Forms 2005 Volume 3 now implements these modes in Row-Layout.
