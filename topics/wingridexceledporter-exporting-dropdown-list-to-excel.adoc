== Exporting the Drop-down List

[[_Ref341518673]]

=== Introduction and preview

Enhancements in exporting data from  _WinGrid_   to excel allow exporting the drop-down list. This is similar to the drop-down controls embedded in WinGrid. Any  _WinGrid_   column that contains value list such as  _WinComboEditor or WinDropDown_   (embedded in  _WinGrid_  ) will display a drop-down list for that column in the exported excel worksheet, unless disabled in the  _WinGridExcelExporter™_  .

The following two screenshots illustrate the before (deployed in WinGrid) and the after (imported to Excel).

=== Property settings

The  _WinGridExcelExporter_   component includes the `ExportValueList` property required for exporting drop-down lists to excel, with its default value – True. You need to change this property to  _False_   if you want to prevent exporting the value lists to excel.
