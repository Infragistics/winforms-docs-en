= Word Document Generation References and Dependencies

Using .NET CLR 4.0 or greater

When using the InfragisticsWord library and exporters to generate a Microsoft® Word®document, the .NET Framework CLR version 4.0 or greater is required. In this scenario, you will reference the Infragistics.WebUI.Documents.IO assembly. The compression and packaging functionality that is built into the Word document creation logic relies on the .NET Framework CLR4.0.
