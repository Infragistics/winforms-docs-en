= Box Annotations

Annotations are used to add extra information or to provide a visual cue to your gauge. Box annotations are rectangles, sometimes with rounded edges, with optional text displayed inside.

For example, if you created a Linear gauge to represent a thermometer, you could create an annotation with the text set to Celsius, to show the unit of measurement.

The following screen shot shows an example of a Radial gauge with a box annotation.
