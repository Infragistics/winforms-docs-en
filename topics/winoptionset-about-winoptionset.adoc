= About WinOptionSet

The WinOptionSet™ control is useful for providing a mutually exclusive selection similar to a set of radio buttons:

* Appearance support -- Full Appearance support including alpha-blending, gradients, Image, etc.
* Item Appearance Support -- Each item in the control's Items collection has its own Appearance object.
* Automatic Text Wrapping -- MinColumnWidth and MaxColumnWidth properties cause text to be automatically wrapped in a multi-line fashion.
* DataBinding -- The WinOptionSet starting in 2005 Volume 3 allows for the binding to a DataSet or DataTable via its DataSource property.
