= Bounds Pane

The Bounds pane determines the size and the location of your annotation on your gauge.

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.boundedannotation~bounds.html[X]"]  -- This value determines the distance of the annotation from the left of the Gauge control, and can be set from 0 to 100. If you set the x value to less than 0 or greater than 100, the annotation will not appear on your gauge.

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.boundedannotation~bounds.html[Y]"]  -- This value determines the distance of the annotation from the top of the Gauge control, and can be set from 0 to 100. If you set the y value to less than 0 or greater than 100, the annotation will not appear on your gauge.

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.boundedannotation~bounds.html[Width]"]  -- The width value can be set from 0 to 100. This value determines the width of your annotation.

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.boundedannotation~bounds.html[Height]"]  -- The height value can be set from 0 to 100. This value determines the height of your annotation.

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.boundedannotation~boundsmeasure.html[Units]"]  -- This value specifies the unit of measurement for your annotation. The annotation can be measured in pixels or as a percentage of the Gauge control.
