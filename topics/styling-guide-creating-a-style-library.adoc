= Creating a Style Library

If you need to make several Style Libraries for one or more applications, you will need to create a new Style Library. If you have just launched AppStylist for Windows Forms, you will see a Start page. In the Open Recent section of the Start page, you can create a new Style Library by clicking the Create New Library button. If you prefer not to use this method, the New Style Library Wizard can guide you through creating a Style Library. The New Style Library Wizard offers three paths:

* <<blank,Start from Existing Library>>
* <<copy,Start from Template>>
* <<template,Blank Library>>

If there are unsaved changes in the currently loaded Style Library, a dialog box will pop up before the New Style Library Wizard appears asking if you'd like to save them.

* Clicking Yes will open the Save As dialog box if this is a new Style Library that has not been saved before; otherwise, AppStylist saves and closes the current Style Library and creates a new Style Library. For more information on saving Style Libraries, see link:styling-guide-saving-your-work.html[Saving Your Work].
* Clicking No will abandon any unsaved changes to the current Style Library and create a new Style Library.
* Clicking Cancel will stop creating a new Style Library and you can continue working on your current one.
