= Displaying a Custom String for a Null Value

This topic applies to all WinEditor™ controls.

The WinEditor controls provide the ability to display a custom string when the control's current value is null (Nothing in VB). An example of the usefulness of this feature is illustrated in the following scenario:

An WinComboEditor™ control, with its DropDownStyle property set to DropDownList, has no selected item. Rather than displaying no text, the developer might want to display a custom string, for example, "(No item selected)".
