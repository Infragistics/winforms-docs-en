= Projects Can Now Be Upgraded Using an XML File

To take advantage of the new functionality and features that we provide in each Infragistics Windows Forms volume release and public hot fixes, you may need to upgrade your existing projects to the latest Infragistics Windows Forms version. For those of you who need to upgrade a large number of projects, we have improved the upgrade process in the 2006 Volume 2 release. Now you can upgrade all of your projects at once by simply creating an XML file, and executing a command that triggers the Project Upgrade Utility to upgrade the projects specified in the XML file.
