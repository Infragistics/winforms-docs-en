= Getting Excel Formula Values into WinGrid

*Before You Begin*

Sometimes you may want to import an Excel file into WinGrid™. Consider an Excel Worksheet that contains some data as well as a column that is calculated by Excel Formulas. This topic will show you how to get the calculated values of Excel Formulas into a WinGrid. Thanks to the Excel Formula Deserialization feature, we are able to get the resulting formula values.

*What You Will Accomplish*

In this walkthrough, you will import data from an excel Worksheet into a dynamically created DataTable and then bind it to WinGrid.

*Follow These Steps*

[start=1]
. Before you start writing any code, you should place using/Imports directives in your code-behind so you don't need to type out a member's fully qualified name. A reference to Infragistics.Documents.Excel and Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid dlls are required for this example code.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Documents.Excel
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid
Imports System.IO
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Documents.Excel;
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid;
using System.IO;
----

[start=2]
. Add the UltraGrid control from your Visual Studio® Toolbox to your Form.
[start=3]
. Add an Excel file named EMPLOYEE_METRICS.xls to the project. The GRAND_TOTAL column contains a Formula that multiplies the SALES and FREQUENCY columns. This is what the Excel file schema and data looks like:

[cols="a,a,a,a"]
|====
|NAME
|SALES
|FREQUENCY
|GRAND_TOTAL

|Tom
|456
|2
|912

|Joe
|443
|1
|443

|Maria
|323
|2
|646

|Ken
|456
|3
|1368

|John
|227
|2
|454

|Reese
|998
|4
|3992

[start=4]
. Add a Button control to your Form. This will be used to initiate the import action. Double click the Button control and place the following code inside its Click event handler:
