= New WinTilePanel Control

The new WinTilePanel™ control provides a rich pattern to quickly browse a set of content panes in a summary form. The WinTilePanel has a Tile layout and a Panel behavior, where multiple Tiles or content panes can be spread across the Panel. Each Tile can have its own content and can be minimized, maximized or set to normal state.

You can drill into a content pane and maximize its view, while continuing to be able to access the remaining content panes which are in a minimized and visible state. Different content can be specified for a Tile in different states. For example, a single Tile in maximum state can have content that is different from the content specified for the same Tile when it is in minimum state.
