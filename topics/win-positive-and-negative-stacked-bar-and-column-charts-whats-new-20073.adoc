= Positive and Negative Stacked Bar and Column Charts

Previously, you could only create stacked bar and stacked column chart types with all positive or all negative data. An exception would be thrown if there were negative values in the data set.

Starting in the Infragistics Windows Forms 2007 Volume 3 release, you can have both negative and positive data in your data set.

Stacked bar and stacked column charts will now render above and/or below zero.

The following screen shot shows a 2D stacked column chart that contains positive and negative values.
