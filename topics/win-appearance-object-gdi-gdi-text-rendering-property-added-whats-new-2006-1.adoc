= GDI/GDI+ Text Rendering Property Added

In the Infragistics Windows Forms 2005 Volume 3 (CLR 2.0) release, if you wanted to render text in GDI+, you had to set the UseGDIPlusTextRenderer to True. Once set to True, all of the controls in your project would render in GDI+. Now, with the new  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.textrenderingmode.html[TextRenderingMode]"]  property added to our base classes, you can select which control(s) on the form you would like to render with GDI+.
