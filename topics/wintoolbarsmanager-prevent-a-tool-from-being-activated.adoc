= Prevent a Tool from Being Activated

Sometimes you do not want a tool to become activated as the mouse is over it. This means that it doesn't exhibit a "mouse over" appearance, such as being given focus or an image change. The tool will still look enabled, but the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintoolbars.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ultratoolbarsmanager~toolclick_ev.html[ToolClick]"]  event will not fire if you click on it.

Add the code below to your project. This will fire as you mouse over a tool and give you the option to check the tool and cancel the event if you like. This will not let the tool to be activated.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub UltraToolbarsManager1_BeforeToolActivate(ByVal sender As Object, _
  ByVal e As Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars.CancelableToolEventArgs) _
  Handles UltraToolbarsManager1.BeforeToolActivate
	If e.Tool.Index = 4 Then
		e.Cancel = True
	End If
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

----
private void ultraToolbarsManager1_BeforeToolActivate(object sender, 
  Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars.CancelableToolEventArgs e)
{
	if(e.Tool.Index == 4)
		e.Cancel = true;
}
