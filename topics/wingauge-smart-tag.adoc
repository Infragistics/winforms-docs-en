= Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005 (.NET Framework 2.0), each Infragistics Windows Forms control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By simply selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WinGauge™ Smart Tag contains the following links:

* About -- Displays the About UltraGauge dialog box for the Gauge control. The dialog box includes license and version information.
* Custom Property Pages -- Opens the Custom Property Pages dialog box. You can use this dialog box to browse and change the properties of the Gauge control rather than use Visual Studio's Properties window.
* Save Preset -- Allows you to save your gauge as a link:wingauge-creating-a-gauge-using-a-preset.html[preset].
* UltraGauge Designer -- Launches the link:wingauge-designer.html[Gauge Designer], which lets you quickly and easily modify the look and feel of your gauge.
