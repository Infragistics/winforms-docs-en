= Composite Chart

A new  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~charttype.html[ChartType]"]  has been added to Chart that allows the composition of existing charts to make new charts. Along with this new chart type, several changes were made to allow for this functionality.

New collections have been added to the Chart:

* A  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.compositechartappearance~series.html[Series]"]  collection can contain multiple Series of data. Each series can contain multiple points of data.
* A  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.compositechartappearance~chartareas.html[ChartAreas]"]  collection can contain separate areas to which chart layers can be added. You can add one or more chart layers to each  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.chartarea.html[ChartArea]"] .
* A  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.compositechartappearance~chartlayers.html[ChartLayers]"]  collection enables multiple chart types to be added to the display.
