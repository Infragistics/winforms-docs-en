= Fill Scene Graph Event

The new FillSceneGraph event eliminates the need for you to create your own custom layer. This event is raised when all of the Primitives have been added to the WinChart's™ scene graph, but before the WinChart is rendered.

The FillSceneGraphEventArgs which is passed to the FillSceneGraphEvent exposes several important members of ChartCore.
