= WinPrintDocument Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005 (.NET Framework 2.0), each Infragistics Windows Forms control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By simply selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WinPrintDocument™ Smart Tag contains the name of the component, as well as the following sections:

* Misc -- Provides various options that will enhance the overall look or performance of the control.
* Serialization -- Provides quick access to properties used in the IPersistComponentSettings interface (new in Visual Studio 2005).

See below for a description of the item (e.g., field, drop-down list, checkbox) in each section, as well as the item's corresponding property in the properties grid.
