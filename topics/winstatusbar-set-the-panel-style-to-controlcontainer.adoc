= Set the Panel Style to ControlContainer

The WinStatusBar™ mimics the behavior of the status bar in a web browser. When a panel is added to the UltraStatusBar with the ControlContainer style, almost any control can be incorporated within the status bar.

== Setting up ControlContainer Style Panel at Design-Time

[start=1]
. Add an UltraStatusBar and a TrackBar to your Windows Form. Select the UltraStatusBar.
[start=2]
. In the Property Pages scroll down to the Panels Property.
[start=3]
. Click the ellipsis to bring up the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinstatusbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinstatusbar.ultrastatuspanelscollection.html[Panels]"]  Collection.
[start=4]
. Click the "Add" button. This will add a new panel.
[start=5]
. Scroll the properties until you come to the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinstatusbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinstatusbar.ultrastatuspanel~style.html[Style]"]  property. Set the Style property equal to ControlContainer.
[start=6]
. Go to the Control property and click on the drop-down arrow. All instantiated controls on the form that can validly be added will be included within the drop-down. Select the "TrackBar1" control.
[start=7]
. Click OK to close the window and you will see your panel with the TrackBar in it added to the status bar.
