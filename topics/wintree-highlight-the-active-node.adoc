= Highlight the Active Node

This topic will guide you through highlighting the Active Node on the tree and giving it a different appearance based on it's position in the tree. For this example, if a node is active, it will show with a red BackColor. If a level 1 child node (a child of a root node) is active, it will show with bold text in addition to the red BackColor. Finally, the code will additionally highlight a node called "Node3" so that it appears with a yellow ForeColor (in addition to the other highlighting) when it is the Active Node.
