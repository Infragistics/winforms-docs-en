= About WinExtras

Infragistics provides the common controls you always wanted. Make anything appear off of a drop-down. Show progress text on top of a progress bar with a simple property. Create rounded buttons with mouse over and click effects. These controls are full of functionality that you won't find in the Microsoft controls, making it easier and more full-featured to build professional and compelling user interfaces with Infragistics' Infragistics controls.

Below, you'll find a list of controls and components that belong to the WinExtras product grouping.

* link:winanimation.html[WinAnimation]™ -- The WinAnimation control is a wrapper for the Microsoft Common Controls animation class. The control provides the ability to play an AVI file or one of several stock AVI files.
* link:winbutton.html[WinButton]™ -- The UltraButton element is a standard button type control. Just as with the inbox button, the UltraButton may be used as the AcceptButton or CancelButton for a Form.
* link:wincalculator.html[WinCalculator]™ -- The WinCalculator control is a customizable calculator that has Appearance support, built-in theming, and allows customizable actions.
* link:windesktopalert.html[WinDesktopAlert]™ -- The WinDesktopAlert™ component is a small window that pops up in the lower-right corner of a computer screen in order to notify the end user of a time-sensitive or important situation. This situation can be an incoming mail, a database update, or perhaps a change in the file system.
* link:windropdown.html[WinDropDown]™ -- The WinDropDown control is a Windows Forms control that can be used with WinGrid to provide a multi-column drop-down list within a grid cell.
* link:windropdownbutton.html[WinDropDownButton]™ -- The WinDropDownButton control is a button type control with the ability to display a drop-down window. The WinDropDownButton may be used as the AcceptButton or CancelButton for a Form.
* link:winformattedlinklabel.html[WinFormattedLinkLabel]™ -- The WinFormattedLinkLabel control can display formatted text as well as several hyperlinks. The control uses XML tags very similar to HTML tags in order to accomplish this; therefore, in order for WinFormattedLinkLabel to render the formatted text, the text needs to be formed into a well formatted XML document.
* link:winlabel.html[WinLabel]™ -- The WinLabel element is a basic label type control. Much of the included functionality in the intrinsic label (autosize, mnemonics, image and text) is provided as well as some additional functionality.
* link:winpopupcontrolcontainer.html[WinPopupControlContainer]™ -- The WinPopupControlContainer element is a Windows Forms component that can display any Windows Forms Control in a drop-down window. The element does not provide any user interface at runtime but displays the specified control when the DropDown method is invoked.
* link:winprogressbar.html[WinProgressBar]™ -- The WinProgressBar control has many properties that allow you to control the display of progress. The colors of the progress bar can vary depending on the current percentage value. Alternatively, the progress bar can be displayed as a filled image.
* link:winscrollbar.html[WinScrollBar]™ -- The WinScrollbar is a Windows Forms control that allows you to add scrolling to a panel or container. Has full appearance support including alpha-blending, gradients, images, etc.
* link:winstatusbar.html[WinStatusBar]™ -- The WinStatusBar is used to display the status of a task, as well can be used to interact with the form by using one of its thirteen different panels.
* link:wintooltipmanager.html[WinTooltipManager]™ -- The WinToolTipManager control adds an extender property called "UltraToolTip" to any Windows Forms control. The UltraToolTip property allows for a control to be managed by WinToolTipmanager. This allows a ToolTip to automatically display when the mouse hovers over the control.
