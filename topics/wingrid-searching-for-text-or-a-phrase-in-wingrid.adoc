= Searching for Text or a Phrase in WinGrid

This topic shows how you can find text or a phrase in your WinGrid cells. Looking for particular text in WinGrid will require iterating through each cell and checking the cell object’s  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcell~text.html[Text]"]  property to see if the string exists. This topic uses the string. Contains method to perform the check. A more elaborate implementation may use more advanced pattern matches such as regular expressions. You can copy and paste this method into your application to add text searching in your WinGrid.
