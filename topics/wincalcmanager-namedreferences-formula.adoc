= NamedReferences Formula

A  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawincalcmanager{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawincalcmanager.namedreference.html[NamedReference]"]  is essentially a formula that is independent of a control. NamedReferences have many uses, such as defining constants or formulas that are used in other calculations but do not need to be visible to the end-user.

The most important properties of the NamedReferences are:

|Property Name|Description

| pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawincalcmanager{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawincalcmanager.namedreference~category.html[Category]"] 
|Used by the FormulaBuilder to organize NamedReferences.

| pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawincalcmanager{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawincalcmanager.namedreference~key.html[Key]"] 
|A unique key for this NamedReference. Key is used to reference the NamedReference in a formula.

| pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawincalcmanager{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawincalcmanager.namedreference~formula.html[Formula]"] 
|The formula for this NamedReference. Note that Formula can be a literal, so that NamedReferences can be used as constants.

| pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawincalcmanager{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawincalcmanager.namedreference~formularesult.html[FormulaResult]"] (run-time only)
|FormulaResult returns the calculated result of the formula.

To add a NamedReference, simply go to the NamedReferences property of the WinCalcManager™ component and click the ellipsis to open the collection editor. Use the Add button to add new NamedReferences to the collection.

To create a constant, simply assign a literal value to the Formula. For example, define a NamedReference with a Key of "Pi" and set the Formula to "3.1415".

To use a NamedReference in a Formula, simply enclose the Key of the NamedReference in square brackets and add a double slash, as in: "[//Pi] $$*$$ [//Radius]^2".
