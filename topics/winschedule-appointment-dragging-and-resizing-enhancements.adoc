= Appointment Dragging and Resizing Enhancements

All the WinSchedule™ controls expose four completely new events for appointments dragging and resizing actions:  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinschedule.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.controlwithactivitybase~appointmentsdragging_ev.html[AppointmentsDragging]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinschedule.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.controlwithactivitybase~appointmentsdragdrop_ev.html[AppointmentsDragDrop]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinschedule.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.controlwithactivitybase~appointmentresizing_ev.html[AppointmentResizing]"] , and  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinschedule.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.controlwithactivitybase~appointmentresized_ev.html[AppointmentResized]"] .

The “ing” events are cancelable, and their event arguments classes expose a property which defines which  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinschedule.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.appointmentsdraggingeventargs~phase.html[phase]"]  of the drag/resize operation the firing represents, i.e., whether it is beginning (first drag after MouseDown), in progress (MouseMove), or ending (MouseUp). Cancellation during any of these phases is fully supported, which results in the appointment times/owner reverting to their pre-drag states. The event arguments classes also expose a read-only collection of appointments which contain references to the actual instances which reside in the Appointments collection. Dragging Appointments from one Owner to another can also be prevented.
