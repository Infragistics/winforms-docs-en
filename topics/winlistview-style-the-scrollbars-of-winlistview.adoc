= Style the Scrollbars of WinListView

In Infragistics Windows Forms 2006 Volume 2, you can style the scrollbars in WinListView™ as you would with WinScrollBar™. We added a  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinlistview{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinlistview.ultralistview~scrollbarlook.html[ScrollBarLook]"]  property to the WinListView that exposes several of the same objects as the WinScrollBar control. By setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinscrollbar.scrollbarlook~appearance.html[Appearance]"]  property of the ScrollBarLook property to an  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.appearance.html[Appearance]"]  object, you can style the entire scrollbar. Alternatively, if you need more control, you can set properties such as  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinscrollbar.scrollbarlook~buttonappearance.html[ButtonAppearance]"] ,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinscrollbar.scrollbarlook~thumbappearance.html[ThumbAppearance]"] , and  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinscrollbar.scrollbarlook~trackappearance.html[TrackAppearance]"] .

The following code will create an Appearance object, set a few of its properties to show a light blue vertical gradient, and than apply that appearance to the WinListView's scrollbars.
