= About WinPopupControlContainer

The WinPopupControlContainer™ element is a Windows Forms component that can display any Windows Forms Control in a drop-down window. The element does not provide any user interface at runtime but displays the specified control when the DropDown method is invoked. The element may also be used with the WinDropDownButton™ element to provide its drop-down window.
