= New Close Button for WinTab and WinTabbedMdiManager

Both Mozilla® Firefox® and Microsoft® Internet Explorer® allow users to browse the internet using a tabbed interface, allowing multiple web sites to be open at the same time. Both of these web browsers allow you to close individual web sites by clicking the close button located on the right side of each tab. Granted, both browsers implement the close button in their own way, but now that we've added a close button to WinTab and WinTabbedMdiManager, you can implement tab-closing functionality that is perfect for your own application.

The new close button on WinTab and WinTabbedMdiManager is more customizable than you'd think. Along with standard link:win-plf-overview.html[Presentation Layer Framework™] capabilities, such as an Appearance object to change the look of the close button, you get several display and position features that help you fine-tune your tabs. You can choose not to include the close button, or you can show it in the selected tab, both the selected tab and HotTracked tab, all tabs, or the header area next to the scroll buttons. Once you decide where to place the close button, if on a tab, you can position the button either near or far, displaying on either the left or right sides, depending on where the tab is displayed.
