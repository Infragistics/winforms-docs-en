= About WinRibbonCustomizationProvider

The WinRibbonCustomizationProvider™ component enables end users to customize the link:wintoolbarsmanager-using-the-ribbon.html[ribbon layout] of the link:wintoolbarsmanager.html[WinToolbarsManager]™ component. The WinRibbonCustomizationProvider™ belongs to the Infragistics.Win.SupportDialogs assembly and implements the link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.iribboncustomizationprovider.html[IRibbonCustomizationProvider] interface. With this interface, the user can manage and customize the appearance of the ribbon and its components.

== Implementing the WinRibbonCustomizationProvider

The UltraRibbonCustomizationProvider component needs to be assigned to the ribbon of the UltraToolbarsManager (see the code below); this adds two customization options for the ribbon to the user’s right-click context menu: Customize Quick Access Toolbar… and Customize the Ribbon… (Figure 1 below). The two options provide a user entry point for customizing the Quick Access Toolbar and the ribbon, respectively: selecting an option opens the Ribbon Customization dialog with the corresponding tab pre-selected (Refer to the Ribbon Customization Dialog topic for details).
