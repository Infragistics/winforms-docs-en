= Linear Gauges

A Linear gauge represents a range of values arranged in a rectangular fashion. The Gauge control usually contains one or more   pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.lineargauge~scales.html[Scales]"]  that represent a specific range. The Needle or Bar  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.lineargaugescale~markers.html[Markers]"]  then move along the axis to point out the current values. A Linear gauge can also be oriented horizontally or vertically. A horizontally oriented gauge is similar to a fuel gauge; a vertically oriented gauge is similar to a thermometer.
