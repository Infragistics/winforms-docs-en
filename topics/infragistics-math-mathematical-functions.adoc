= Mathematical Functions

The Infragistics Math Library™ provides an all-purpose class of mathematical functions designed to act on a variety of mathematical objects.

== Classes and Methods

link:{ApiPlatform}math{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.compute.html[Compute] is a static class, which contains methods that act as extensions of the functions from link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.aspx[System.Math] class.

The methods in the link:{ApiPlatform}math{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.compute.html[Compute] class have overloads for the different data types in the Infragistics Math Library – complex numbers, vectors, and matrices.
