= Getting to Know AppStylist for Windows Forms

Knowing your way around AppStylist for Windows Forms is essential to creating professionally themed applications. AppStylist's user interface is divided into three sections: Canvas, Style Explorer, and Properties Panel. Each of these sections provides unique functionality that will help you style your application.

* link:styling-guide-canvas.html[Canvas] -- The Canvas is divided into tabbed sections, each containing a sample form. These sample forms contain several configurations of Infragistics controls and components that you might encounter in your own application. As you change the appearance of link:styling-guide-roles.html[UI Roles], you will see the changes reflected in the canvas.
* link:styling-guide-properties-panel.html[Properties Panel] -- The Properties Panel is where you change the appearance of UI Roles and other component-specific settings. The Properties Panel is simply a container. Inside the Properties Panel, you will find the UI Role Editor, Component Role Editor, Shared Object Role Editor, or Resource Editor depending on what type of role you select in the Role tree of the Style Explorer.
* link:styling-guide-style-explorer.html[Style Explorer] -- The Style Explorer is the navigator of AppStylist. Through the styles tab, you can expand the tree and change all kinds of properties and settings. When you click on a particular Role or setting, the corresponding properties show up in the Properties Panel; from here, you can change the actual appearance of those Roles and settings. Other features of the Style Explorer include managing StyleSets and link:styling-guide-resources.html[Resources].
