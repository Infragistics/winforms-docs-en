= Infragistics CAB Extensibility Kit Add-On

The Composite UI Application Block (CAB) framework was released by the Microsoft® patterns & practices team as a proven practice to building enterprise-class smart-client applications. The CAB framework is a source code-based component based on Microsoft Visual Studio® 2005 (.NET Framework 2.0).

As part of the Infragistics Windows Forms 2006 Volume 1 release, we are offering the Infragistics CAB Extensibility Kit™. This product is an add-on to the Infragistics Windows Forms (CLR 2.0) product, extending the Infragistics Windows Forms product to provide seamless interoperation with the CAB framework. This add-on gives development teams the power to develop sophisticated smart client applications using the controls and components in the Infragistics Windows Forms toolset. The kit also allows development teams to provide rich, fine-grained appearances and behaviors to enterprise-class applications using predefined looks and feels, presets, and appearance settings.

The Infragistics CAB Extensibility Kit installs a Infragistics CompositeUI source-code solution and a quick start solution (ported from Microsoft) that utilizes Infragistics Windows Forms controls/components -- the key items to get your CAB application seamlessly integrated with the Infragistics Windows Forms (CLR 2.0) product.
