= Radial Gauges

A Radial gauge visualizes data in a circular fashion. Although a Radial gauge can also be square, the Needle and Bar markers that represent current values, rotate in a circular fashion (similar to the hands of a clock).

Typically, a Radial gauge can be designed to be a complete circle, half of a circle, or one-quarter of a circle. One or more sections can be added to represent the range of possible values. Markers that represent a specific value can then be added to point out where within the sections these values reside.
