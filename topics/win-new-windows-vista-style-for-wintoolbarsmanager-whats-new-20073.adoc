= New Windows Vista Style for WinToolbarsManager

Microsoft's® Windows® Vista™ user interface (UI) is a significant change from past UIs. The UI brings a modernized and friendly feel to the Windows experience. This release, Infragistics is proud to offer you that same look and feel for WinToolbarsManager™ in our new Windows Vista Look and Feel. At this time, the look and feel only affects WinToolbarsManager and those controls/components that we use to create WinToolbarsManager's components.

=== Toolbars

Toolbars use the WindowsVistaToolbarButton ButtonStyle for its buttons. You can also see unique horizontal and vertical gradients on the toolbars, both including the glass effect.

=== Menus

Toolbar menus also support the Vista style. The most notable feature is an animated fade in which makes for a unique hover effect.
