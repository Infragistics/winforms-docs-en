= Limiting Band Indentation

Occasionally, you may want to save screen space by limiting the amount of indentation used when displaying child bands. The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridband~indentation.html[Indentation]"]  property controls the amount of space used when indenting.

Code controlling the overall appearance of the WinGrid™ is usually placed within the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragrid~initializelayout_ev.html[InitializeLayout]"] event. Enter the following code for the element's InitializeLayout event handler.

Set the Indentation property of the specified Bands object.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Setting this value equal to zero disables indentation of child bands.
====

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub Limit_Band_Indentation_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
	Me.UltraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Bands(1).Indentation = 5
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

----
private void Limit_Band_Indentation_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
	this.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Bands[1].Indentation = 5;
}
----

The following screen shots show the difference with this property set. The first one shows what a standard indentation looks like for WinGrid. The second shows what it looks like using the above code.
