== Terminal Symbols Overview

=== Terminal symbols summary

Terminal symbols define a group of characters the lexical analyzer should recognize as a unit when it is creating tokens. In addition to a unique name allowing the parser to distinguish it from other symbols, it also defines what text it can possibly represent. For example, a grammar might have a terminal symbol named “SemicolonToken” which indicates it can only represent “;” and a terminal symbol named “IdentifierToken” which indicates it can represent an underscore or letter followed by zero or more underscores, letters, or digits.

The terminal symbols are represented by the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.terminalsymbol.html[TerminalSymbol] class in the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing_namespace.html[Infragistics.Documents.Parsing] namespace.

== Defining Terminal Symbols

=== Defining terminal symbols summary

Each link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.lexerstate.html[LexerState] has a link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.lexerstate~symbols.html[Symbols] collection containing the `TerminalSymbol` instances that can be matched by the lexer when it is in that state. In addition to containing the `TerminalSymbol` instances, the `Symbols` collection is also the means by which new `TerminalSymbol`s are created since `TerminalSymbol` does not have a public constructor. Here is the signature of the Add method on the Symbols collection which creates a `TerminalSymbol`:

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
public TerminalSymbol Add(
    string name,
    string value = null,
    TerminalSymbolComparison comparison = TerminalSymbolComparison.Literal,
    bool isExitSymbol = false)
----

.Note
[NOTE]
====
There is another link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.lexerstateterminalsymbolcollection~add.html[Add] method on the `Symbols` collection which takes a `TerminalSymbol` instance. This can be used to add a `TerminalSymbol` to multiple lexer states. It can be created in one `LexerState`, and then the created instance can be added into other `LexerState` in the same link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.grammar.html[Grammar]. In this way, a `TerminalSymbol` can be matched in multiple states of the lexer.

== Regular Expression Support

=== Summary

In the `Symbols` collection `Add` method, If the comparison specified for a new `TerminalSymbol` is `RegularExpression`, the value parameter is interpreted as a regular expression string. Regular expressions allow for a concise description of a set of strings.

=== Basic features

In addition to literal strings in the expression, there are certain operators that can be used to combine and enhance regular expressions to define larger and more complex sets. Here is a breakdown of some very basic regular expression features supported by the Syntax Parsing Engine:

[options="header", cols="a,a,a,a"]
|====
|*Construct*|*Description*|*Example*|* Set of strings described by the example*

|_literal character_
|Any literal character which is not reserved as another kind of construct. This represents the set consisting of one string of just that character.
|A
|{ “A” }

|( _expression_ )
|Grouping. Groups a regular expression within the parentheses and does not change the set described by that expression.
|(A)
|{ “A” }

|_expression1_ | _expression2_
|Alternation. Any two regular expressions separated by a ‘|’. Represents the set of all strings described by either the first expression or the second.
|A|B
|{ “A”, “B” }

|_expression1 expression2_
|Concatenation. Any regular expression followed by another regular expression. Represents the set of all strings in the set of the first expression concatenated with all strings in the set of the second expression.
|(A|B)C
|{ “AC”, “BC” }

|_expression_ $$*$$
|Kleene Closure. A regular expression followed by ‘$$*$$’. Represents zero or more concatenations of the set described by the expression preceding the ‘$$* $$’.
|(A|B)$$*$$
|{ “”, “A”, “B”, “AA”, “AB”, “BA”, “BB”, “AAA”, “AAB”, … }

=== Supported functionality

The Syntax Parsing Engine conforms to the same syntax as link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs600312.aspx[.NET Framework Regular Expressions] but only supports a subset of its functionality. This allows for a much faster lexical analysis at a cost of ability to define certain regular expressions. Here is the list of .NET Framework Regular Expression features as well as the features currently supported by the Parsing Engine (this list is taken from MSDN, which can be found link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az24scfc.aspx[here]):

|*\a*
|Matches a bell character, \u0007.
|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\b*
|In a character class, matches a backspace, \u0008.
|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\t*
|Matches a tab, \u0009.

|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\f*
|Matches a form feed, \u000C.
|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\n*
|Matches a new line, \u000A.
|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\e*
|Matches an escape, \u001B.
|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\* _nnn_
|Uses octal representation to specify a character ( _nnn_ consists of two or three digits).
|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\x* _nn_
|Uses hexadecimal representation to specify a character ( _nn_ consists of exactly two digits).
|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\c* _X_ 

*\c* _x_

|Matches a Unicode character by using hexadecimal representation (exactly four digits, as represented by _nnnn_ ).
|image::images/Yes.png[]

|*\*
|When followed by a character that is not recognized as an escaped character in this tables in this topic, matches that character. For example, *\$$*$$* is the same as *\x2A*, and *\.* is the same as *\x2E*. This allows the regular expression engine to disambiguate language elements (such as $$*$$ or ?) and character literals (represented by \$$* $$ or \?).
