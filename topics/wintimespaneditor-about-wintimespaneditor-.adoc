= About WinTimeSpanEditor

The WinTimeSpanEditor™ control provides you with an editor to enter duration with any format you specify. A minimum and maximum value can be set and you can increment or decrement the time span values using the spin buttons. This editor control can be used as a stand-alone control or can be embedded within any control that supports embeddable editors (e.g., WinGrid, WinTree, WinSchedule controls). The WinTimeSpanEditor control derives from WinTextEditor™.

Following are some of the additional features for WinTimeSpanEditor:

* Appearance support – Full appearance support including alpha-blending, gradients, image, etc.
* Built-in theming – Supports Standard, Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003, Visual Studio 2005, Office 2007 themes, WindowsVista, and ScenicRibbon.
* Ink-enabled – The user can switch between freeform ink input and virtual keyboard input.
* Overflow indicator -- A customizable text overflow indicator image with tooltip support for the full text.
* Null text – Display a custom string when the control's current value is null.
