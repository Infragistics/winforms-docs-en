= Creating a Radial Gauge in Design View

This topic shows you how to add a Radial Gauge to WinGauge.

[start=1]
. In Design view, click the UltraGauge control on your form.
[start=2]
. In the Properties window, click the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingauge.ultragauge~gauges.html[Gauges]"]  property. Then, click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Gauges collection editor.
[start=3]
. In the Gauges collection editor, click Add, and select Add Radial Gauge.

[start=4]
. At this point, the Radial Gauge has been added, but it is not visible because certain properties have not been set. To start configuring the Gauge, expand the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgauge~dial.html[Dial]"]  property.
[start=5]
. Create a new BrushElement object by clicking the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gauge~brushelement.html[BrushElement]"]  property. Then from the drop-down list, select Solid Fill.
[start=6]
. Expand the BrushElement property, and set the color property to Silver.
[start=7]
. At this point, you should see the Radial Gauge dial.

[start=8]
. Create a new Scale by clicking the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgauge~scales.html[Scales]"]  property . Then from within the drop-down list, click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Scale Collection editor.
[start=9]
. Click Add to create a new Scale.
[start=10]
. Create a new Axis object by clicking the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugescale~axis.html[Axis]"]  property of the Scale. Then, from the drop-down list, select Numeric Axis.
[start=11]
. Expand the Axis property, and set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugerange~startvalue.html[StartValue]"]  property to 0. Then set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugerange~endvalue.html[EndValue]"]  property to 100\.
[start=12]
. Create a new BrushElement object by clicking the BrushElement property. Then from the drop-down list, select Solid Fill.
[start=13]
. Expand the BrushElement property, and set the Color property to White.
[start=14]
. Set the StartAngle property to 100, and the EndAngle property to 435. Setting these properties change where the Section begins and ends, and puts a small space between the start and end.
[start=15]
. Notice that the Scale touches the outer border of the dial. Change this by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugerange~outerextent.html[OuterExtent]"]  property to 85.
[start=16]
. So far if you run the project, it should look like the form below.

[start=17]
. Add major Tickmarks to the Scale by expanding the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugescale~majortickmarks.html[MajorTickmarks]"]  property. Then, create a new BrushElement by clicking the BrushElement property, and from the drop-down list, select Solid Fill.
[start=18]
. Expand the BrushElement property, and set the Color property to Black.
[start=19]
. In order to align the outer edge of the Tickmarks, set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugeneedle~endextent.html[EndExtent]"]  property to 85, which is the same as that of the Section that we added earlier.
[start=20]
. The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugeneedle~startextent.html[StartExtent]"]  property must also be changed so that its value is less than the EndExtent property. Set the StartExtent property to 75.
[start=21]
. Notice there are too many Tickmarks. Reduce them by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugescaletickmarkappearance~frequency.html[Frequency]"]  property to 10. This will cause a Tickmark to be painted every 10 units that were defined in the Axis.
[start=22]
. At this point, if you run the project, it should look like the form below:

image::Images\Gauge_Adding_a_Radial_Gauge_04.png[]

[start=23]
. Now all that is needed is a marker that indicates the current value that should be displayed. Click the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugescale~markers.html[Markers]"]  property of the Scale, and click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Markers Collection editor.

[start=24]
. Click Add and select Add Needle.
[start=25]
. The needle has now been added but is not visible because a Brush Element has not been created.
[start=26]
. Create a new BrushElement object by clicking the BrushElement property. Then from the drop-down list, select Solid Fill.
[start=27]
. Expand the BrushElement property, and set the Color property to Red.
[start=28]
. The Needle is still not visible because a Value was not specified. Set the Value property to 20\.
[start=29]
. To shorten the length of the Needle, set the MidExtent property to 65 and set the EndExtent property to 80\.
[start=30]
. Run the project. It should look similar to the form below.
