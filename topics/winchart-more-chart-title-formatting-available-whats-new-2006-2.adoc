= More Chart Title Formatting Available

The 2006 Volume 2 release now offers you more flexibility in how you can format your chart titles. New properties allow you to:

* change the direction of the chart title (i.e., horizontal or vertical)
* reverse the text of the horizontal or vertical chart title
* change the angle of the chart title's orientation
* clip the text of the chart title if there is not enough room to display it
* wrap the text of the chart title onto multiple lines when it exceeds a certain length

In the example chart below, notice that the chart title is wraps on multiple lines.
