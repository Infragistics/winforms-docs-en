= About WinTimeZoneEditor

The WinTimeZoneEditor™ control provides a ComboBox-like control whose list is pre-populated with the names of the time zones found in the registry. Like the UltraComboEditor class (from which it derives), the UltraTimeZoneEditor element contains such additional features as:

* Appearance support -- Full Appearance support including alphablending, gradients, image, etc.
* Item Appearance Support -- Each item in the control's Items collection, as well as it's edit portion, has its own Appearance object which means that each item can have a distinct font, foreground color, background color, image, etc.
* Built-in Theming -- Supports Standard, Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003, Visual Studio 2005, and Office 2007 themes.
* Ink-enabled -- The user can switch between freeform ink input and virtual keyboard input.
* Null Text -- Display a custom string when the control's current value is null.
* Most Recently Used (MRU) Feature -- Display a list of the most recently entered information.
* Automatic Word Completion -- The edit portion is automatically updated to match an item in the items list as new characters are typed.
* List Sorting -- Multiple sorting options specify how list items will be sorted when displaying value list items in the drop down list.
