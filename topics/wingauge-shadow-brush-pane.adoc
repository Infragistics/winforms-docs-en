= Shadow Brush Pane

The Shadow Brush pane lets you specify the brush type and color of the shadow that you added to a property (e.g., needle marker).

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.shadow~brushelement.html[Brush Type]"]  -- This drop-down list lets you change the brush type of the property.

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.shadow~brushelement.html[Brush Color]"]  -- Depending on which brush type you select, the brush color list will populate with the colors available for that brush type.

Relative Bounds Editor -- This pop-up menu displays two bounds editors, link:wingauge-relative-bounds.html[Relative Bounds] and link:wingauge-relative-clip-bounds.html[Relative Clip Bounds], that allows you to determine the size and location of your brush element.
