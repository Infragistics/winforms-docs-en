= About Gauge Ranges

The  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingauge.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugerange.html[Range]"]  property of the WinGauge control is a visual element that begins and ends at specified values on a scale. The Range property allows you to highlight specific parts of the scale. For example, on a vehicle tachometer, the high RPM zones, which are usually yellow and red, indicate that the engine is running higher than the optimal load.
