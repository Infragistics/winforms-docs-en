= Prevent the Navigator from Being Displayed

If you do not want the WinDockManager's™ Navigator to display when the user presses Ctrl-Tab, set the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawindock.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawindock.navigatorsettings~enabled.html[Enabled]"]  property under  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawindock.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawindock.navigatorsettings.html[NavigatorSettings]"]  to False. Setting the Enabled property to False only disables the Navigator from the user (Ctrl-Tab). Even if this property is set to False, you can still display the Navigator through code. If you would like to show the Navigator using code (i.e. when a button is clicked), see link:windockmanager-show-the-navigator-programmatically.html[Show the Navigator Programmatically].

.Note
[NOTE]
====
If your WinDockManager is on a form that will be a MDI child, you will need to show the navigator programmatically as the key combination will not show the navigator in this scenario by design.
