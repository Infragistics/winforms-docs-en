= Refresh WinNavigationBar's Locations

If you are using WinNavigationBar™ to display a file system or a database, you may need to implement a means to refresh the file system or data. If you are populating each Location at once, you can place your initialize code in a method that reloads the data. If you are lazily populating WinNavigationBar and are using the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultranavigationbar~initializelocations_ev.html[InitializeLocations]"]  event to do so, your work is already done. The meat of this procedure is the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultranavigationbarlocation~reset.html[Reset]"]  method, exposed by every  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultranavigationbarlocation.html[UltraNavigationBarLocation]"]  collection. The Reset method accepts a Boolean value which identifies whether or not the InitializeLocations event should fire again for each location.

In order to refresh WinNavigationBar, create a method that

[start=1]
. Accepts the current path as a parameter
[start=2]
. Resets all the Locations in the RootLocation
[start=3]
. Reinitializes WinNavigationBar
[start=4]
. Navigates back to the current path

Step 3 will differ depending on how you are initializing WinNavigationBar. You could either call a method which runs initialization code, or leave step 3 empty if you are lazily populating WinNavigationBar.

The following code demonstrates how to refresh the WinNavigationBar control by resetting all its Locations and then navigating back to the current path. Call this method in a button's Click event and pass in the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultranavigationbar~selectedlocation.html[SelectedLocation's]"]  full path. You can use the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.misc.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultranavigationbarlocation~getfullpath.html[GetFullPath]"]  method to retrieve the SelectedLocations's full path.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub RefreshFileSystem(ByVal path As String)
    ' Reset all of the locations under RootLocation. Also, pass
    ' True to the Reset method so the InitializeLocations event
    ' will fire again for each location.
    Me.UltraNavigationBar1.RootLocation.ResetLocations(True)
    ' TODO:
    ' If you are not lazily populating WinNavigationBar, place
    ' initialization code here.
    ' Navigate back to the path you stored. As WinNavigationBar
    ' parses through this path, it will fire InitializeLocations
    ' for each item in the path.
    Me.UltraNavigationBar1.NavigateTo(path, True)
End Sub

*In C#:*

----
private void RefreshFileSystem(string path)
{
	// Reset all of the locations under RootLocation. Also, pass
	// True to the Reset method so the InitializeLocations event
	// will fire again for each location.
	this.ultraNavigationBar1.RootLocation.ResetLocations(true);
	// TODO:
	// If you are not lazily populating WinNavigationBar, place
	// initialization code here.
	// Navigate back to the path you stored. As WinNavigationBar
	// parses through this path, it will fire InitializeLocations
	// for each item in the path.
	this.ultraNavigationBar1.NavigateTo(path, true);
