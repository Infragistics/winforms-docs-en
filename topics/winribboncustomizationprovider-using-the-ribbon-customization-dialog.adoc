= Using the Ribbon Customization Dialog

This topic explains the Ribbon Customization dialog, its implementation, and the end-user interactions with it.

toc::[]

== Introduction

The Ribbon Customization Dialog enables end users to customize ribbon tabs, groups and tools. It is implemented through the WinRibbonCustomizationProvider control. Once implemented, users can access through options in their right-click context menu (For details, refer to the About WinRibbonCustomizationProvider topic).

This dialog displays two tabs by default: Customize Ribbon and Quick Access Toolbar (QAT). Their corresponding customization controls are the RibbonCustomizationControl (Customize Ribbon tab) and the QATCustomizationControl (Customize Quick Access Toolbar tab). On its left, the Customize Ribbon tab lists all ultraToolbarsManager items (AvailableItemsView); on the right, it shows the ribbon’s content and structure (RibbonLayoutView) – tabs, groups, and tools:

[NOTE]
====
You can use the RibbonCustomizationControl and the QATCustomizationControl also in custom-created dialogs.

[[EnableRibbonCust]]
== Enabling Ribbon Customization

To enable customizing the existing/default/stock tabs, groups and tools, use the link:{ApiPlatform}win.supportdialogs{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.supportdialogs.ribboncustomizationprovider.ultraribboncustomizationprovider~stockitemmodificationoptions.html[StockItemModificationOptions] property on of the UltraRibbonCustomizationProvider component. This property is of flag enumeration type: you need to specify the type of stock item modification that you want to allow for your users. By default, this property is set to None.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1.StockItemModificationOptions = Infragistics.Win.SupportDialogs.RibbonCustomizationProvider.StockItemModificationOption.AllowTabModify
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1.StockItemModificationOptions = Infragistics.Win.SupportDialogs.RibbonCustomizationProvider.StockItemModificationOption.AllowTabModify;
----

[[DisableRibbonCust]]
== Disabling Ribbon Customization

To disable customization of the Ribbon or the Quick Access Toolbar, use the link:{ApiPlatform}win.supportdialogs{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.supportdialogs.ribboncustomizationprovider.ultraribboncustomizationprovider~allowribboncustomization.html[AllowRibbonCustomization] or link:{ApiPlatform}win.supportdialogs{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.supportdialogs.ribboncustomizationprovider.ultraribboncustomizationprovider~allowqatcustomization.html[AllowQATCustomization] properties of the UltraRibbonCustomizationProvider component. Setting these properties to false will prevent the corresponding context menu option (Customize the Ribbon or Customize Quick Access Toolbar) from being available to the user.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
' Disable customization of Ribbon
Me.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1.AllowRibbonCustomization = False
' Disable customization of Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)
Me.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1.AllowQATCustomization = false
----

*In C#:*

----
// Disable customization of Ribbon
this.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1.AllowRibbonCustomization = false;
// Disable customization of Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)
this.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1.AllowQATCustomization = false;
----

[[Events]]
== Events

The ability to modify the dialog is provided by the BeforeCustomizationDialogDisplayed and AfterCustomizationDialogClosed events of the UltraRibbonCustomizationProvider component.

The UltraToolbarsManager component also exposes two events: BeforeRibbonCustomizationDialogDisplayed and AfterRibbonCustomizationDialogClosed.

[[ShowCustDialog]]
== Showing the Customization Dialog

The UltraToolbarsManager’s Ribbon exposes the ShowRibbonCustomizationDialog method to display the dialog at run time. The RibbonCustomizationType argument of this method specifies which tab: Customize Ribbon or Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) should be active on the dialog.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars
Me. ultraToolbarsManager1.Ribbon. ShowRibbonCustomizationDialog (RibbonCustomizationType. QuickAccessToolbar)
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars;
this.ultraToolbarsManager1.Ribbon.ShowRibbonCustomizationDialog(RibbonCustomizationType.QuickAccessToolbar);
----

[[PopularCommands]]
== Adding the Popular Commands Functionality

The customization dialog displays all the tools added to ultraToolbarsManager when the Choose Commands From combo box is set to All Commands. You can, however, group the tools that are more commonly used as a Popular Commands tool using the PopularCommand property. This property allows displaying the tools when the Choose Commands From combo box is set to Popular Commands.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars
Dim pasteTool As New StateButtonTool("Paste")
Me.ultraToolbarsManager1.Tools.Add(pasteTool)
pasteTool.SharedProps.Caption = "Paste"
pasteTool.SharedProps.PopularCommand = True
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars;
StateButtonTool pasteTool = new StateButtonTool("Paste");
this.ultraToolbarsManager1.Tools.Add(pasteTool);
pasteTool.SharedProps.Caption = "Paste";
pasteTool.SharedProps.PopularCommand = true;
----

[[CustDefault]]
== Customizing the Default Tabs, Groups and Tools

To customize the existing/default/stock tabs, groups and tools, use the StockItemModificationOptions property on the UltraRibbonCustomizationProvider. The type of this property is a flags enumeration allowing you to specify which type of modifications can be made to stock items. The available enumeration values are:

* All
* AllowGroupAddTools
* AllowGroupModify
* AllowGroupRemove
* AllowGroupReposition
* AllowGroupShowHide
* AllowTabAddGroups
* AllowTabChangeContextualGroup
* AllowTabModify
* AllowTabReposition
* AllowTabRemove
* AllowTabShowHide
* AllowToolModify
* AllowToolRemove
* AllowToolReposition
* AllowToolShowHide
* None

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars
'  Allow Modification of all default Tabs, Groups and Tools
Me.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1.StockItemModificationOptions = Infragistics.Win.SupportDialogs.RibbonCustomizationProvider.StockItemModificationOption.All
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars;
// Allow Modification of all default Tabs, Groups and Tools
this.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1.StockItemModificationOptions = Infragistics.Win.SupportDialogs.RibbonCustomizationProvider.StockItemModificationOption.All;
----

[[ResetButton]]
== Implementing the Reset Button Functionality

By default, this save point for the Reset button functionality is created when the design-time initialization of the Ribbon is complete. However, a method called CreateRestorePoint is also exposed on the ultraToolbarsManager that provides the ability to create the save point. This allows to programmatically design/change the Ribbon and have those changes included in the “default” layout. The Restore method restores the UltraToolbarsManager to this internally-saved restore point.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
' Create a save point for UltraToolbarsManager
Me.ultraToolbarsManager1.CreateRestorePoint()
' Restore UltraToolbarsManager to the saved restore point
Me.ultraToolbarsManager1.Restore()
----

*In C#:*

----
// Create a save point for UltraToolbarsManager
this.ultraToolbarsManager1.CreateRestorePoint();
// Restore UltraToolbarsManager to the saved restore point
this.ultraToolbarsManager1.Restore();
----
