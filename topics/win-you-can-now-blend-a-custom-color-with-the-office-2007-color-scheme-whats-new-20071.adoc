= You Can Now Blend a Custom Color with the Office 2007 Color Scheme

In the 2006 Volume 3 release, we offered the Office 2007 look and feel. With this look and feel came three distinct color schemes: blue, black, and silver. Although visually appealing, being able to use only three colors out of more than 65,000 is a little restricting. Therefore, in 2007 Volume 1, we're giving you the ability to blend any color with the three existing color schemes. Using the new  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.office2007colortable~customblendcolor.html[CustomBlendColor]"]  property off the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.office2007colortable.html[Office2007ColorTable]"]  object, you can blend any system color with the Blue, Black, or Silver color schemes.
