= Adding OlapDataSelector

=== Overview

Although a separate control, the data selector link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinpivotgrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinpivotgrid.dataselector.olapdataselector_members.html[OlapDataSelector], Similar to the `MdxDataSelector`, is an essential mechanism for the  _WinPivotGrid_  control when used with FlatDataSource. Binding the data selector to the same data source as the pivot grid, the  _WinPivotGrid_  displays the list of dimensions and measures that the user can interact with at runtime by adding them to the pivot grid.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
If the data selector is not present at runtime, you will not be able to add the dimensions. You can only remove them from the pivot grid.
