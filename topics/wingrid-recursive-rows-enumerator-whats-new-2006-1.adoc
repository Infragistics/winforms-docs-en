= Recursive Rows Enumerator

We've now made it easier for you to loop through all rows and bands in a grid by using a new enumerator. Previously, you would have had to create an entire recursive method just to accomplish this task. Now, with the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridband~getrowenumerator.html[GetRowsEnumerator]"]  method, you can use a single foreach loop to traverse through all rows in all bands of the grid.
