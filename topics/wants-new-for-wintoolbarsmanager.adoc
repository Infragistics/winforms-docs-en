= What's New for WinToolbarsManager

== Ribbon Customization

With the release of Office 2010, Microsoft® provides their users the ability to customize the layout of the Ribbon within each Office application. This release of Infragistics Windows Forms 2011 Volume 1 provides the ability for end users to modify WinToolbarsManager™ component’s Ribbon layout, in a similar manner.

== New Component – WinRibbonCustomizationProvider™

The customization is achieved with a new component called WinRibbonCustomizationProvider™, which when hooked to WinToolbarsManager provides a new dialog that exposes the customization functionality.

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars;
this.ultraToolbarsManager1.Ribbon.RibbonCustomizationProvider = this.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars
Me.ultraToolbarsManager1.Ribbon.RibbonCustomizationProvider = this.ultraRibbonCustomizationProvider1
----

== New Context Menu Items – Customize the Ribbon and Customize Quick Access Toolbar

Two new context menu items – Customize the Ribbon and Customize Quick Access Toolbar is automatically available on the Ribbon as soon as the WinRibbonCustomizationProvider component is hooked up to WinToolbarsManager.
