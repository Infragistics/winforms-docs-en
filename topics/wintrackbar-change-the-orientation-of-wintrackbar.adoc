= Change the Orientation of WinTrackBar

Many of Infragistics' Windows Forms controls, as well as several of Microsoft's in-box controls, are able to be situated on the form both horizontally and vertically; WinTrackBar is included in this group of controls able to be oriented both horizontally and vertically. You can perform this action easily by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawineditors{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawineditors.ultratrackbar~orientation.html[Orientation]"]  property. By default, WinTrackBar sits on the form horizontally. If you set the Orientation property to Orientation.Vertical, WinTrackBar will display vertically.
