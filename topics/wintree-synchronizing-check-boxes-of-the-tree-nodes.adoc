= Synchronizing Check Boxes of the Tree Nodes

Synchronizing Checkboxes of the Tree Nodes

== Topic Overview

=== Purpose

This topic demonstrates synchronizing checkboxes of the  _WinTree_™ between parent and child nodes.

=== Introduction

In standard view, the  _WinTree_   already has the ability to display checkboxes on nodes. This feature provides the ability to synchronize the checkboxes automatically such that a parent node displays checked, unchecked or in an indeterminate state, based on the checked state of its child nodes.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
This feature only applies to nodes in the standard view of the tree nodes, not column views.
====

The following table illustrates how the checkbox states are synchronized and displayed.

|Checkbox synchronization|Checkbox state

|Parent is checked if all children are checked.

|Parent is unchecked if all children are unchecked.

|Parent is indeterminate if some children are checked and others unchecked.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
This feature only applies to checkboxes appearing as follows:

* Applies to nodes appearing in front of a result of the link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintree{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.override~nodestyle.html[NodeStyle] property
* Does not apply to nodes displayed as either in a grid or in an  _OutlookExpress_   style
* Does not apply to checkboxes in cells or columns
====

=== Example

Following is the code that enables checkbox synchronization via the `NodeStyle` property.

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
ultraTree1.Override.NodeStyle = NodeStyle.SynchronizedCheckBox;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
ultraTree1.Override.NodeStyle = NodeStyle.SynchronizedCheckBox
----
