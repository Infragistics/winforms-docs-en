= About WinLabel

The WinLabel™ control is a basic label type control. Much of the included functionality in the intrinsic label (autosize, mnemonics, image and text) is provided as well as some additional functionality, including:

* Appearance support -- Full Appearance support including alphablending, gradients, etc.
* HotTracking -- Alter the appearance of the label when the mouse is over the element.
* BorderStyleInner/BorderStyleOuter -- The two borderstyles can be used to create additional border effects - "bump" border, etc. The InnerBorderPadding controls the space allocated between the inner and outer border.
* ImageSize -- Control the size of the image displayed in the label.
* WrapText -- Determines whether text will wrap when the element is not wide enough to display the entire text.
