= Save/Load a Layout to a File

WinGrid™ can save and reload a previously saved layout allowing your end users to setup the WinGrid in a particular fashion for their needs and come back and restore it to that layout. For example say an end user always wants the data shown in the grid to be GroupBy a particular column. He could make his GroupBy and save the layout, and then next time he opens the form just reload the saved layout and the GroupBy is applied.
