= Touch Gestures

=== Introduction

The topics in this group illustrate Infragistics touch-enabled control’s Touch Gestures.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
The functionality offered through this feature is only available in a Full Trust environment.
====

Touch Gestures now support a new link:{ApiPlatform}win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultracontrolbase~gesturesenabled.html[GesturesEnabled] property in the Infragistics link:{ApiPlatform}win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultracontrolbase_members.html[UltraControlBase] class. This is Boolean property (`True` by default), which allows enabling gestures support for the application. Presented along with each gesture-supported control is an instance of the link:{ApiPlatform}win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultracontrolbase~gesturesenabled.html[GesturesEnabled] property. This empowers the controls with the ability to enable and disable the individual gestures separate from the application level.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
When set explicitly the control settings have precedence over the application settings.
