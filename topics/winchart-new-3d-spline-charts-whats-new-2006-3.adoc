= New 3D Spline Charts

To complement our link:chart-spline-chart-2d.html[2D Spline] and link:chart-spline-area-chart-2d.html[2D Spline Area] charts, we are now offering the link:chart-spline-chart-3d.html[3D Spline] and link:chart-spline-area-chart-3d.html[3D Spline Area] charts, respectively. These new 3D charts add another dimension (z-axis) to the existing 2D charts, resulting in more visually appealing charts.
