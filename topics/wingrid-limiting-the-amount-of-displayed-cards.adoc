= Limiting the Amount of Displayed Cards

You can specify how many Cards show on WinGrid™ at any given time. You can configure the maximum amount of Cards to show horizontally and vertically by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcardsettings~maxcardareacols.html[MaxCardAreaCols]"]  and  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcardsettings~maxcardarearows.html[MaxCardAreaRows]"]  properties off the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcardsettings.html[CardSettings]"]  object, respectively.

Keep in mind that if you want to reset the MaxCardAreaCols and MaxCardAreaRows properties, you can set their values to 0.
