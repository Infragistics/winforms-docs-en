== _WinToolbarsManager_

[[_Ref382587855]]

=== Configurable tab item visibility

This feature allows developers to configure the visibility of the Ribbon tab items by showing or hiding tab items. Hiding tab items also reduces the height of the ribbon area; reclaiming the remaining room.

[[_Ref382587860]]

=== Prioritized tools’ visibility

This feature introduces the tool’s priority property allowing tools to be prioritized whenever toolbar space is limited due to data usage. When there is not enough room for a toolbar to display all of its tools, the toolbar will sort the tools displaying more frequently used tools, and moving less frequently used tools to a bumped toolbar.

Each tool exposes a link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.sharedprops~priority.html[Priority] property on the `SharedProps` object providing developers a way to specify the tool’s level of importance. Additionally, the  _UltraToolbarsManager_   keeps a counter of tool usage (known as usage data), which is also taken into consideration when sorting the tools.

The  _UltraToolbarsManager_   class exposes a new property link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ultratoolbarsmanager~toolsortingprecedence.html[ToolSortingPrecedence] allowing users to specify the priority taking precedence over the usage data.

== _WinCombo_,  _WinComboEditor_

[[_Ref382587774]]

=== Ignoring diacritics on Autocomplete

This feature provides the developer with the ability to ignore diacritics in search strings either including or excluding the words with diacritics or accent marks in searched result.

== _WinGrid_

[[_Ref382587678]]

=== Disabling delete row confirmation

This feature provides the developer with a new property for disabling the confirmation dialog when the user attempts to delete a row.

By default, when selecting and deleting a row from the  _WinGrid_  , prompts a confirmation dialog reconfirming the user’s intentions before deleting the row.

[[_Ref382587845]]

=== Configurable spellchecker underline

Configure the spellchecker underline using the link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinspellchecker.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinspellchecker.ultraspellchecker~underlineverticaloffset.html[UnderlineVerticalOffset] property, which accepts positive and negative integer values for setting the vertical offset for the underline positioned beneath misspelled words.

=== New Node Editor Designer dialog

As in modern UIs, the new Designer Dialog presents icon buttons on top of the dialog, for creating and modifying the tree nodes. The dialog includes a descriptions area for the properties where developers can see vital information about the properties during design time.

Drag-and-Drop capability is available on the designer dialog to reposition nodes. The buttons change their enabled state based on the tree structure and node selection.
