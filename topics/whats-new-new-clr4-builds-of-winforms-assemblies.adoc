= New CLR4 Builds of WinForms Assemblies

With the 2011 Volume 2 release of Infragistics Windows Forms, your solutions can run the latest version of the CLR4 framework and take advantage of our assemblies using the same CLR version.

== Creating a New Windows Forms Application with CLR4

To create an application with CLR4, when creating a new project in Visual Studio, be sure to select .NET Framework 4 options, as shown in Figure 1 below.

(New Project dialog > framework selection drop-down (at the top-left of the middle pane) > .NET Framework 4)

When you drag one of the Infragistics controls to the form in Design View, Visual Studio will automatically use the proper CLR build of the referenced assembly.
