= You Can Now Determine if a Cell Has Been Allocated in Memory

As the end user modifies cells in WinGrid™, WinGrid allocates more memory based on the the end user's modifications. With the new  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridrow~hascell.html[HasCell]"]  method off the Row object, you can now determine if WinGrid has allocated a cell. You can then use the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridrow~deallocatecells.html[DeallocateCells]"]  method to remove the allocated cell from memory.
