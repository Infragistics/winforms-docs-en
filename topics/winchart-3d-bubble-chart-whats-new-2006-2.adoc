= 3D Bubble Chart

To complement our link:chart-bubble-chart-2d.html[2D Bubble chart] (a variation of the link:chart-scatter-chart.html[Scatter chart]) we are now offering the 3D Bubble chart, which adds another dimension (z-axis) to the existing chart, resulting in a more visually appealing chart.
