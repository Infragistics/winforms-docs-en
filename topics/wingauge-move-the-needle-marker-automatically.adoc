= Move the Needle Marker Automatically

This topic explains how you can configure the needle on your Radial gauge to move automatically. For example, if you created a Radial gauge to represent a clock, you could configure the hands of the clock to move automatically, giving the impression of a real-time clock.

This topic assumes that you have a Radial gauge already created. For information on how to create a gauge, see link:wingauge-creating-a-radial-gauge-in-design-view.html[Creating a Radial Gauge in Design View].

*To move the needle marker automatically on your gauge:*

[start=1]
. From the components tab, drag the Timer component to your form.
[start=2]
. In the Properties window, set the Enabled properties to True.
[start=3]
. In the component tray, double click the Timer component.
[start=4]
. The following example code accesses the needle marker on your Radial gauge and increases the value by 5. Place the code in the timer1_Tick method:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Dim myRadialGauge As RadialGauge = Me.ultraGauge1.Gauges(0)' Access Needle marker
Dim myMarker As RadialGaugeMarker = myRadialGauge.Scales(0).Markers(0)
Dim currentValue As Integer = CInt(myMarker.Value)
' Increases needle by 5
myMarker.Value = currentValue + 5
----

*In C#:*

----
RadialGauge myRadialGauge = this.ultraGauge1.Gauges[0] as RadialGauge;
// Access Needle marker
RadialGaugeMarker myMarker = myRadialGauge.Scales[0].Markers[0];
int currentValue = (int)myMarker.Value;
// Increase needle by 5
myMarker.Value = currentValue + 5;
----

[start=5]
. In the Properties window, click the   pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gauge.html[Gauges]"]  property. Then, click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Gauges collection editor.
[start=6]
. Locate the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgauge~scales.html[Scales]"]  property and click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Scales collection editor.
[start=7]
. Locate the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugescale~markers.html[Markers]"]  property and click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Markers collection editor.
[start=8]
. Expand the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugemarker~response.html[Response]"]  property.
[start=9]
. Set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugemarkerresponse~enabled.html[Enabled]"]  property to True. The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugemarkerresponse~refreshrate.html[RefreshRate]"]  property is the amount of time between each update of the gauge. Set the RefreshRate property to 00:00:00.1000000. The ResponseRate property is the amount of time taken for the marker to traverse the entire scale of the gauge. Set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugemarkerresponse~responsetime.html[ResponseTime]"]  property to 00:00:01. Setting the Response property gives your bar a smoother appearance as it increases along the scale;your bar marker doesn't appear as if it is jumping from value to value.
[start=10]
. Save and run the application.
