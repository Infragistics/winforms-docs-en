= Vectors

The Infragistics Math Library™ provides functionality for working with vectors.

== About Vectors

Vectors are one-dimensional data classes for storing collections of objects. link:{ApiPlatform}math.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.math.vector.html[Vector] can be a link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_vector[Row Vector] or a link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_vector[Column Vector].

== Using Vectors

Infragistics Math Library supports the following vector classes:

* link:{ApiPlatform}math.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.math.vector.html[Vector] – stores a collection of real numbers
* link:{ApiPlatform}math.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.math.booleanvector.html[BooleanVector] – stores a collection of boolean values
* link:{ApiPlatform}math.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.math.complexvector.html[ComplexVector] – stores a collection of complex numbers

These classes are all derived from the link:{ApiPlatform}math.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.math.matrixbase.html[MatrixBase] class. They differ in the data types they store.

The following topics will guide you how to use vectors in the Infragistics Math Library:
