= GroupBy View

WinGrid™ supports an intuitive and powerful way to organize your data - GroupBy view. GroupBy view gives the user the ability to create custom groupings of records on the fly and to work with customized "mini-datasets" that focus on just the records of interest.

GroupBy mode is similar to a concept found in Microsoft Outlook, and it works in the same way. For a grid that has GroupBy mode enabled, there is an area in each band called the GroupByBox. The user can drag column headers into this area to create custom groupings. When a column is added to the GroupByBox, it is hidden from view (by default - you can override this behavior) and the rows of the band are divided into groups by the appearance of  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridgroupbyrow.html[UltraGridGroupByRows]"] . GroupByRows display the information contained in the column being used to group the data, and they provide a mechanism to expand and collapse the rows that make up the group.

You can enable GroupBy mode by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridlayout~viewstyleband.html[ViewStyleBand]"]  property of the element's  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridlayout.html[UltraGridLayout]"]  (accessible via the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridbase~displaylayout.html[DisplayLayout]"]  property.)

The following snapshot displays WinGrid with GroupBy view. Data is grouped by Country and then City in the root band and EmployeeID in the child band.
