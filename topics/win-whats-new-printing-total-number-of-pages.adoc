= WinGridPrintDocument Printing Total Number of Pages

With this new feature, the WinGridPrintDocument™component allows an additional replacement string (<##> or <Total Pages>) to print the total number of physical pages that will be printed. Previously, it was possible to print only the current physical page number (e.g. “Page<#>”).
