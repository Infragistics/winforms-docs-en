|Methods|Description

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~fromreference.html[FromReference]
|This static method obtains a reference to the associated link:{ApiPlatform}undo.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager_members.html[UndoManager] instance. The method takes an already registered object as a parameter.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~registerreference.html[RegisterReference]
|Associates an object with a specific `UndoManager` instance. 

This method is helpful when 

* you do not want to maintain an object strong reference to an `UndoManager` instance 

* you do not want to use the shared thread static UndoManager instance returned by the link:{ApiPlatform}undo.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~current.html[Current] property 

The references are maintained via weak references so it is not mandatory to unregister them.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~unregisterreference.html[UnregisterReference]
|Removes the registration of an object to an `UndoManager` instance.
