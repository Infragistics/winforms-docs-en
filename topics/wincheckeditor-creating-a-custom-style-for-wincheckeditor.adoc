= Creating a Custom Style for WinCheckEditor

== Before You Begin

Using WinCheckEditor's GlyphInfo object, you can change the look and feel to a familiar, operating system-themed style, or an up-to-date Microsoft® Office® 2007 style. However, in the 2008 Volume 2 release of Infragistics Windows Forms, we allowed you to add any custom image for each state that WinCheckEditor can exist in. You can set these custom images using the Check Box Designer.

== What You Will Accomplish

You will learn how to create a custom style for WinCheckEditor using the Check Box Designer.

== Follow these Steps

.. With WinCheckEditor still selected, locate the GlyphInfo property in the properties window and click the ellipsis to the right of the window. The Check Box Designer appears.
