= Enabling Card View

To enable Card View, you simply need to set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridband~cardview.html[CardView]"]  property to True. The band that you wish to set to Card View is the Band where you must set the CardView property. The following code sets Band 0 to Card View. Again, note that whichever Band you set to Card View will be the last visible Band in the WinGrid™ control's hierarchy. If you have lower level Bands, they will not be visible.
