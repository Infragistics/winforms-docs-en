= The ChartLayout Class

The ChartLayout class can be thought of as a class that persists the state of the Chart. In this application, we are only using one Chart control in such a way that it appears that many charts are being used. This is made possible by placing the Chart control within the WinGrid cell that is active and then setting Chart properties from values stored in the WinGrid cell associated ChartLayout.

The ChartLayout class can be further expanded and elaborated to contain more property settings that represent your requirements for a Chart in your application, however, in this example, the ChartLayout persists:

*  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~charttype.html[ChartType]"]  (e.g., PieChart, BarChart, ColumnChart)
*  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~datasource.html[DataSource]"]  (e.g., DataTable, Collection, IEnumerable List)
*  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~image.html[Image]"]  – This is an Image representation or snapshot of the Chart in its last active state.
*  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.colorappearance.html[ColorAppearance]"]  - This represents the color scheme used to generate the Chart data elements.
*  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~titletop.html[TitleTop]"]  – This contains the Chart’s title or descriptive caption (e.g., Orders For Customer XYZ)
