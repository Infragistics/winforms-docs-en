== Methods and Properties Reference for Merging Undo/Redo Operations

[[_Ref321129447]]

=== Introduction

In some cases, you may want to have the previously added undo operation to be updated with information about the new change. For example - while typing in a text control or while dragging the thumb of a Slider control, then you may want to merge the related changes into one.

This merging operation is performed automatically by the framework and it is enabled by default.

You can disable merging or configure the amount of time since the last operation after which merging will not be performed.
