= About WinGauge

The WinGauge control graphically depicts one or more data values within a range of values using needles and markers. The control is commonly used in dashboard-style user interfaces found in enterprise and industrial applications. You can consider the Gauge control itself as a surface that can host one or more individual gauges. Gauges can be arranged in any fashion to achieve the most complex series of readouts.
