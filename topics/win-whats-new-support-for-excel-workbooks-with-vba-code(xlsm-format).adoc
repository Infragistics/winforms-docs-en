= Support for Excel Workbooks with VBA code(XLSM Format)

The Infragistics Excel Engine™ is now capable of loading Microsoft® Excel® workbooks that have VBA code embedded in them. Previously, when saving workbooks that had VBA code, all the VBA code was lost. With this new feature it is now possible to round-trip VBA code from a loaded workbook when it is saved out again.
