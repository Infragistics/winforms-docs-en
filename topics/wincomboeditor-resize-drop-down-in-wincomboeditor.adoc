= Resize Drop-Down in WinComboEditor

The drop-down of WinComboEditor™ control can be resized using a handle, which can be positioned at the bottom of the drop-down either vertically or diagonally. This handle enables you to resize the dropdown and view any text or item in the drop-down that has been truncated due to the size of the control. By default the DropDownResizeHandleStyle property is set to ‘None’. When set to a particular style and resized at run time, the resized height and width of the drop-down will be stored for that run of the application. You can also style the handle using the link:infragistics4.win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.valuelist~dropdownresizehandleappearance.html[DropDownResizeHandleAppearance] property.

The following code assumes that you have an UltraComboEditor control dropped onto your form and bound to some data.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
' Set the Drop Down Resize handle style for UltraComboEditor 
Me.ultraComboEditor1.ValueList.DropDownResizeHandleStyle = Infragistics.Win.DropDownResizeHandleStyle.DiagonalResize 
' Set the back color for the handle 
Me.ultraComboEditor1.ValueList.DropDownResizeHandleAppearance.BackColor = Color.Blue
----

*In C#:*

----
// Set the Drop Down Resize handle style for UltraComboEditor
this.ultraComboEditor1.ValueList.DropDownResizeHandleStyle = Infragistics.Win.DropDownResizeHandleStyle.DiagonalResize;
// Set the back color for the handle
this.ultraComboEditor1.ValueList.DropDownResizeHandleAppearance.BackColor = Color.Blue;
