= Move the Bar Marker Automatically

This topic explains how you can configure the bar marker on your Linear gauge to move automatically. For example, if you created a Linear gauge to represent a thermometer, you could configure the mercury level to rise and fall, simulating a real thermometer.

This topic assumes that you already created a Linear gauge. For information on how to create a gauge, see link:wingauge-getting-started-with-wingauge.html[Getting Started with WinGauge].

*To move the needle automatically on your gauge:*

[start=1]
. From the Component tab of the toolbox, drag the Timer component to your form.
[start=2]
. In the Properties window, set the Enabled property to True.
[start=3]
. In the component tray, double click the Timer component.
[start=4]
. The following example code accesses the bar marker on your Linear gauge and increases the value by 5. Place the code in the timer1_Tick method:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Dim myLinearGauge As LinearGauge = Me.ultraGauge1.Gauges(0)' Access Bar marker
Dim myMarker As LinearGaugeMarker = myLinearGauge.Scales(0).Markers(0)
Dim currentValue As Double = CInt(myMarker.Value)
' Increases needle by 5
myMarker.Value = currentValue + 5
----

*In C#:*

----
LinearGauge myLinearGauge = this.ultraGauge1.Gauges[0] as LinearGauge;
// Access Bar marker
LinearGaugeMarker myMarker = myLinearGauge.Scales[0].Markers[0];
int currentValue = (int)myMarker.Value;
// Increase needle by 5
myMarker.Value = currentValue + 5;
----

[start=5]
. In the Properties window, click the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gauge.html[Gauges]"]  property. Then, click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Gauges collection editor.
[start=6]
. Locate the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgauge~scales.html[Scales]"]  property and click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Scales collection editor.
[start=7]
. Locate the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugescale~markers.html[Markers]"]  property and click the ellipsis (…) button to open the Markers collection editor.
[start=8]
. Expand the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugemarker~response.html[Response]"]  property.
[start=9]
. Set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugemarkerresponse~enabled.html[Enabled]"]  property to True. The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugemarkerresponse~refreshrate.html[RefreshRate]"]  property is the amount of time between each update of the gauge. Set the RefreshRate property to 00:00:00.1000000. The ResponseRate property is the amount of time taken for the marker to traverse the entire scale of the gauge. Set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gaugemarkerresponse~responsetime.html[ResponseTime]"]  property to 00:00:01. Setting the Response property gives your bar a smoother appearance as it increases along the scale; your bar marker doesn't appear as if it is jumping from value to value.
[start=10]
. Save and run the application.
