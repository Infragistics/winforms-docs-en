=== Introduction

The ObservableCollectionExtendedWithUndo class provides automatic support for recording the changes to the collection with an UndoManager instance.

The class provides two overloaded constructors:

* One without parameters which uses the UndoManager instance returned from the static link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager~current.html[Current] property.

* One that takes as parameter a reference to link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undomanager_members.html[UndoManager] with which the collection changes are recorded as part of the undo/redo history.
