= Tile States

The WinTilePanel™ control allows each tile to be in one of the following states: Normal and Large. By default, all the tiles added to the control will be in Normal state. In normal state, the TilePanel maintains a uniform height and width of all the Tiles.

At any given time, at least one tile must be in the normal state. By default, only one tile can be maximized as a large tile, though any number of tiles can be maximized by setting the UltraTilePanel control’s  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultratilepanel~maximumvisiblelargetiles.html[MaximumVisibleLargeTiles]"]  property to an integer value. It is possible to determine and set the state of any tile through its State property.

This topic assumes that you have an UltraTilePanel control dropped onto your form. For information on adding tiles to the UltraTilePanel control please see the link:wintilepanel-add-and-remove-tiles-through-code.html[Add and Remove Tiles through Code] topic.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
' Set the maximum number of tiles whose state can be set to Large
Me.ultraTilePanel1.MaximumVisibleLargeTiles = 3
' Determine the state of the Tile 
Dim stateofTile As Infragistics.Win.Misc.TileState = tile1.State
MessageBox.Show(stateofTile.ToString())
----

*In C#:*

----
// Set the maximum number of tiles whose state can be set to Large
this.ultraTilePanel1.MaximumVisibleLargeTiles = 3;
// Determine the state of the Tile
Infragistics.Win.Misc.TileState stateofTile = tile1.State;
MessageBox.Show(stateofTile.ToString());
