=== FlatDataSource

=== Compact / SuperCompact views

The WinPivotGrid now provides additional row header layout options (Compact and SuperCompact). This allows to organize the row headers by freeing unused space from the row header area where applicable, and allocate it for presenting data.

==== Available row layout options are:

*  _Compact_   – Child headers are superimposed over their parent row headers.
*  _Standard_   – Each level appears as a separate column in the layout.
*  _SuperCompact_   – All headers occupy only one logical column.

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
ultraPivotGrid1.RowHeaderLayout = Infragistics.Win.UltraWinPivotGrid.RowHeaderLayout.Compact;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
ultraPivotGrid1.RowHeaderLayout = Infragistics.Win.UltraWinPivotGrid.RowHeaderLayout.Compact
----
