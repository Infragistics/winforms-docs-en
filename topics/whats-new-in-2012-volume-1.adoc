[[ExcelEngine]]
== Infragistics Excel Engine

The following table summarizes the new Infragistics Excel Engine features included with the 2012 Volume 1 release.

=== Accessing Cells and Regions by their Reference Name

The Worksheet object’s link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheet~getcell.html[GetCell] and link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheet~getregion.html[GetRegion] methods now accept a reference name denoting a cell or range. Previously these methods accepted only the address of the cell or region.

=== Excel format support

Excel library now supports accessing built-in styles, parent styles, format options, numerous Microsoft Excel behaviors regarding styles, and possibility for determining resolved cell formats.

=== Excel 2007 Color Model

This release introduces an updated color object model. Using Excel 2007 Color model you can specify a color, work with Workbook palette and use new link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.iworksheetcellformat~fill.html[Fill] property for filing a cells.

=== Support named tables in an Excel spreadsheet

The Excel library now supports the ability to access and create named Tables with data from the worksheet. The tables can be sorted, filtered, and aggregated.

* link:excelengine-support-named-tables-in-an-excel-spreadsheet.html[Support Named Tables in an Excel spreadsheet]

=== Filtering tables

Filtering is done by applying a filter. When the filter is applied on a column, all filters in the table will be reevaluated to determine which rows should be visible. This operation will show rows where all cells meet their table columns’ filter criteria.

==== Related Topics:

* link:excelengine-filtering-tables.html[Filtering Tables]

=== Sorting tables

Sorting is done by setting a sorting condition on a table column. When a sorting condition is set on a column, all sort conditions in the table will be reevaluated to determine the order of the cells in the table. When cells need to be moved to meet their sort criteria, the entire row of cells in the table is moved as a unit. If the data in the table is subsequently changed, the sort condition will not be reevaluated.

=== Getting cell text

This topic describes how to determine the text that would be displayed in a Microsoft Excel cell given the cell’s value, format string, column width, and worksheet options.

== WinGanttViewPrintDocument

[[WinGanttViewPrintDocument]]

Starting with 2012 Volume 1 of Infragistics Windows Forms, end-users can print the content of the UltraGanttView™ used in your application. This is achieved through a new component called UltraGanttViewPrintDocument™ which is added to the Windows Forms toolset. This component gives you full control over positioning and customization of legends in the printed document, in a way similar to that of the Microsoft® Project.

[[WinGridExternalFiltering]]
== WinGrid - External Filtering

Starting with 2012 Volume 1 of Infragistics Windows Forms, the WinGrid™ control allows external filtering. With external filtering, it is possible to filter data on WinGrid with custom filtering logic and also have the Load-On-Demand functionality enabled. Previously, when filtering was performed, the UltraGrid control used to load all rows and iterate over all of them making the link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.loadstyle.html[LoadOnDemand] setting ineffective. Now it is possible to bypass this internal filtering logic, but retain the built-in filtering UI and supply custom filtering code.

For details on how to use this feature, see the link:wingrid-enabling-external-filtering.html[Enabling External Filtering] topic.

[[WinGridExternalSummaryCalculations]]
== WinGrid - External Summary Calculations

Starting with 2012 Volume 1 of Infragistics Windows Forms, it is possible to perform summary calculations on the WinGrid™ control along with the Load-On-Demand feature enabled. Previously, when summary calculations were performed, the WinGrid controls’ calculation logic used to iterate through the rows collection and load all data. Now it is possible to bypass this internal summary calculation logic and supply the summary value directly, without requesting all of the data to be loaded and thereby avoiding the iteration of the rows collection.

For details on how to use this feature, see the link:wingrid-performing-external-summary-calculations.html[Performing External Summary Calculations] topic.

[[WinGridRowsCollection]]
== WinGrid - Rows Collection in Filter Changed Events

In the WinGrid™ control, the event arguments in the `BeforeRowFilterChanged` and `AfterRowFilterChanged` events contain a `RowsCollection` that make it easier to perform external processing and filtering. A `RowsCollection` is provided during the `BeforeRowFilterChanged` and `AfterRowFilterChanged` events that expose the rows the column filter is being applied to.
