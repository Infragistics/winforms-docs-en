= About the MainMenu Toolbar

Toolbars are 'tool containers' that can contain zero or more tools. Their default visual representation and behavior duplicates that of the toolbars in Microsoft Office. When tools reside on a toolbar, they are rendered as buttons and arranged horizontally or vertically depending on the orientation of the toolbar. The DisplayStyle property of the tool determines whether the tool is displayed with an image and/or Text.

Internally, WinToolbarsManager™ represents toolbars with the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintoolbars.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ultratoolbar.html[UltraToolbar]"]  class.

== The MainMenuBar

There is a special type of Toolbar called a MainMenuBar. MainMenuBars are regular UltraToolbar objects that have their  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintoolbars.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ultratoolbar~ismainmenubar.html[IsMainMenuBar]"]  property set to True. When a toolbar is designated as a MainMenuBar in this way, it has certain characteristics that make it different from other toolbars:

* It is always visible
* It fills the entire dock area row on which it appears. No other toolbar will appear on the same row.
* If it is defined in an UltraToolbarsManager that resides on an MDI Child form, it is automatically merged with the MDI Parent's main menu regardless of their keys
* All of its tools are always visible - tools are wrapped to multiple lines if there is not enough width on the first line
* When PopupMenu Tools appear on a MainMenuBar, the small downward pointing arrow that is drawn to the right of the tool's text when it appears on a regular toolbar, is not drawn.

Here are screenshots of a toolbar with its IsMainMenuBar property set to True and False:
