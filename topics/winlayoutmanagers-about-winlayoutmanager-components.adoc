= About WinLayoutManager Components

The two components that are part of this grouping are:

* link:winflowlayoutmanager.html[WinFlowLayoutManager]™ -- is a component which positions control. It eliminates the task of programmatically positioning the controls on a Form, by doing it for you.
* link:wingridbaglayoutmanager.html[WinGridBagLayoutManager]™ -- is a component which offers flexible automatic positioning and resizing capabilities for controls in a container (ex. in a Form). This component uses the notions of logical columns and logical rows to provide a straightforward way for you to specify the relative positioning and sizing of the various controls being managed.
