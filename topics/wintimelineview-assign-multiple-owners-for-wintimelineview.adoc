= Assign Multiple Owners for WinTimelineView

Multiple Owners can be specified for the WinTimelineView™ control and  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.appointment.html[Appointments]"]  can be assigned for each Owner. Owners are displayed as rows in WinTimelineView. The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.owner.html[Owners]"]  object usually represents a person, department, or other entity by which you might want to group appointments by. The Owners are added to the WinCalendarInfo™ component’s Owners collection.

This topic shows you how Owners can be associated with the WinTimelineView control. It is assumed that you have an ultraTimelineView control, and the UltraCalendarInfo and UltraCalendarLook components dropped onto your form.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.ultraCalendarInfo1.Owners.Add("Charlie") 
Me.ultraCalendarInfo1.Owners.Add("Jamie") 
Me.ultraCalendarInfo1.Owners.Add("Leah") 
' Hide the UnassignedOwner available by default 
Me.ultraCalendarInfo1.Owners.UnassignedOwner.Visible = False 
Me.ultraCalendarLook1.ViewStyle = Infragistics.Win.UltraWinSchedule.ViewStyle.Office2007 
Me.ultraTimelineView1.CalendarInfo = Me.ultraCalendarInfo1 
Me.ultraTimelineView1.CalendarLook = Me.ultraCalendarLook1
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraCalendarInfo1.Owners.Add("Charlie");
this.ultraCalendarInfo1.Owners.Add("Jamie");
this.ultraCalendarInfo1.Owners.Add("Leah");
// Hide the UnassignedOwner available by default
this.ultraCalendarInfo1.Owners.UnassignedOwner.Visible = false;
this.ultraCalendarLook1.ViewStyle = Infragistics.Win.UltraWinSchedule.ViewStyle.Office2007;
this.ultraTimelineView1.CalendarInfo = this.ultraCalendarInfo1;
