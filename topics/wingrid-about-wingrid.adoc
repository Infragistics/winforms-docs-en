= About WinGrid

WinGrid™ is a hierarchical data bound grid control. It has full support for displaying hierarchical data provided by any data source that implements IList, IBindingList or ITypedList.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
WinGrid must be bound to data. In other words if you do not bind WinGrid to a DataSource, it cannot be used. If you wish to use WinGrid in an "unbound" fashion, you must create a data model that represents the information you wish to display and then bind it to WinGrid.
====

There are several extensibility features built right in to WinGrid that make working in the WinGrid control a productive and convenient task. Export your data directly to Microsoft® Excel® with the WinGridExcelExporter™ control. Use the grid-like WinDropDown™ control to assist end-users with data entry. Easily print out your entire WinGrid with the WinGridPrintDocument™ control.

The grid supports editing and a host of other features such as:

* Sorting – user can sort data in any column simply by clicking the column header. Sort a single column or multiple columns.
* Filtering – Allow the end user to filter the data any way they want.
* Outlook GroupBy – Groups rows with similar values together, just like Microsoft® Outlook.
* User-resizable columns and rows – Users can click and drag the edges of rows or columns. Double-clicking will autosize rows or columns.
* Fixed headers – Add fixed columns to your grid so they will always display regardless of scroll position, just like Microsoft® Excel®.
* Row layouts – Arrange the cells and headers in a row using GridBagLayouts.
* Card View – Display rows as cards.
* And of course, all of the standard Infragistics Presentation Layer Framework feature like Appearances, DrawFilters, and CreationFilters.
