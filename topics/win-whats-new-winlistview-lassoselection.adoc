= WinListView LassoSelection

One feature familiar to users of Windows Explorer is “lasso selection”, which has now been added to the WinListView™ control. The phrase “lasso selection” refers to the selection rectangle which you drag around one or more items in the view, resulting in them being selected. This feature enables you to select a range of values in the WinListView.
