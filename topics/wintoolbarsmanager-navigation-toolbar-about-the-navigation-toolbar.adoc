= About the Navigation Toolbar

With the Navigation toolbar, your end users can navigate backwards and forwards through a history of items that they create based on their actions through the user interface. When the end user performs an action (i.e. navigates to an internet site, browses to a system folder, peruses a database), you can add the location that resulted from the action to the Navigation toolbar's navigation history. Once an item is added to the history, the Navigation toolbar takes care of the navigation.

Just like any other toolbar, the Navigation toolbar contains a tools collection, allowing you to add any of our WinToolbarsManager™ tools to the toolbar's tools area. This enables you to create any type of navigation interface similar to Microsoft® Internet Explorer® 7 or Windows® Vista™ Windows Explorer.
