= Misc Pane

The Misc pane determines the size of the blub at the start of the bar in a Linear gauge. An example of a blub in a Linear gauge is the blub part of a thermometer. For a Radial gauge, the Misc pane determines the start angle for the bar marker.

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.lineargaugebarmarker~bulbspan.html[Bulb Span]"]  -- The value of the blub span can be set from 0 to 100 using the numeric slider. However, you can also enter a value into the text box. This value is the size of the blub

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugebarmarker~startangle.html[Start Angle]"]  -- Set this value to an integer from 0 to 360. It specifies the start angle for the bar marker on a Radial gauge.

pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.lineargaugebarmarker~segmentspan.html[Segment Span]"]  -- The value of the segment span can be set from 0 to 100 using the numeric slider. However, you can also enter a value into the text box. This value is the percentage of the entire bar marker that each segment should occupy.
