= New WinGanttView Control

With this release we have added an interactive WinGanttView™ control to our growing list of Windows Forms controls. The WinGanttView control is similar in functionality to that of Microsoft® Project and offers a similar front end for project management.

This control allows you to effectively create project management software by providing support for Tasks, Summary Tasks, Milestones, Deadlines, PercentComplete, Dependencies,Constraints and Tooltips. It provides a tabulated list in the form of a Grid as well as a Gantt chart representation of the various project details. The column headers in the chart section of the control can display time intervals and horizontal scrollbars similar to the WinTimelineView™ control. WinGanttView gets its functionality through the WinCalendarInfo™ component that is also used by WinSchedule control.
