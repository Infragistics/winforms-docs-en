= Touch-enabled WinTilePanel

== Topic Overview

=== Purpose

This topic illustrates Infragistics Touch-Enabled  _Win_  _TilePanel_™ control elements.

== Touchable  _WinTilePanel_   Elements

=== Touchable element

The touch elements appear slightly larger when viewed with Touch mode enabled than with it disabled. The control’s link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultrapanel~getpreferredsize.html[GetPreferredSize] method uses the touch metrics as the minimum size, allowing the control to be either Auto-Sized, or explicitly sized by the application developer as a Touch-Friendly size.

The following touchable elements as illustrated in the screenshot below, are used by the tile for:

*  *Tile header area*  – Dragging-and-Dropping
*  *State button*  – Minimizing and maximizing
*  *Close button*  – Closing or removing from the view

====
In normal view gestures are converted into mouse actions allowing the use of a finger to drag tiles around and to interact with buttons by tapping on them.
