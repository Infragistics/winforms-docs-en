= Visual Studio 2008 Window Style for WinDockManager

With the release of Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2008 came a new docking pane style, both for Windows® XP and Windows Vista. We've emulated this new style in WinDockManager, enabling you to use Visual Studio 2008-style docking in your applications. You can access this new style by setting the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawindock.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawindock.ultradockmanager~captionstyle.html[CaptionStyle]"]  and  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawindock.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawindock.ultradockmanager~windowstyle.html[WindowStyle]"]  properties to VisualStudio2008.

In addition, the drag indicators for Windows Vista look quite different than those in Windows XP, so we've added a new  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawindock.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawindock.ultradockmanager~dragindicatorstyle.html[DragIndicatorStyle]"]  enumeration to give your application the Vista look and feel.

You may also have noticed that the Navigator has been given a completely different look in Visual Studio 2008, including a preview of the selected item. Don't worry, we've added all the necessary appearance objects and preview capability to the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawindock.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawindock.ultradockmanager~navigatorsettings.html[NavigatorSettings]"]  object.
