= Save and Restore a Layout

You can set up the interface of an WinExplorerBar™ control either at design-time through the property sheet or UltraExplorerBar Designer, or you can do it at run-time by setting various properties through code. When your application runs, the user can further customize the interface by adding Groups, re-arranging Groups, dragging Items from one Group to another, and so on.

At any point, you can save the current layout of the UltraWinExplorerBar element to a file, which can be re-loaded in the future to restore the element's layout. At run-time, you also have the option of persisting the element's layout to (and restoring it from) a storage stream. The layouts persisted by the element include all of the property values maintained by the various Settings objects in the element, which encapsulate all of the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.appearance.html[Appearances]"]  used in the element. This includes the objects returned by the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinexplorerbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinexplorerbar.ultraexplorerbargroupsettings.html[GroupSettings]"]  and  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinexplorerbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinexplorerbar.ultraexplorerbaritemsettings.html[ItemSettings]"]  properties of the element, the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinexplorerbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinexplorerbar.ultraexplorerbargroup~settings.html[Settings]"]  and  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinexplorerbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinexplorerbar.ultraexplorerbargroup~itemsettings.html[ItemSettings]"]  properties of the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinexplorerbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinexplorerbar.ultraexplorerbargroup.html[Group]"] , and the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinexplorerbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinexplorerbar.ultraexplorerbaritem~settings.html[Settings]"]  property of the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinexplorerbar{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinexplorerbar.ultraexplorerbaritem.html[Item]"] . The Groups collection of the element (and all of the Item objects encapsulated by the Groups within it) are also persisted.
