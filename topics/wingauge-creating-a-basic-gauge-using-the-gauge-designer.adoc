= Creating a Basic Gauge Using the Gauge Designer

== Before You Begin

Creating a Radial gauge using the Gauge Designer:

* allows you to save your gauge as a preset and use it for future applications
* allows you to see your gauge as it is being created in the interactive preview area
* simplifies the process of editing the properties on your gauge

== What You Will Accomplish

Using the Gauge Designer to create a basic Radial gauge will help you understand the fundamentals of the Gauge Designer.

== Follow these Steps
