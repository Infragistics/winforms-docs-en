= Customizing How WinSpellChecker Spell Checks Documents

WinSpellChecker™ is capable of customizing the end user's spell checking experience through a unique SpellOptions object. This object carries several properties that tell the spell checking engine what to check, what not to check, and what kind of suggestions to give. Most of these properties are simple Booleans that are easy to understand, such as whether or not to allow capitalized words or even words with a few capital letters in them. Some of these properties go deep into the heart of the spell checking engine and determine whether or not the engine will use hashing or phonetics to suggest corrections for misspelled words. Each property is explained in detail below along with its default value and an example to help you understand exactly what happens when you change the default value.

bum

| pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinspellchecker{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinspellchecker.spelloptions~allowmixedcase.html[AllowMixedCase]"]

| pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinspellchecker{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinspellchecker.spelloptions~allowxml.html[AllowXml]"] 
|True
|WinSpellChecker does not attempt to check the spelling of XML and HTML tags. For example, the tags in the Example column would be ignored.

<span>

| pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinspellchecker{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinspellchecker.spelloptions~checkcompoundwords.html[CheckCompoundWords]"] 
|False
|WinSpellChecker ignores words that should be separated by a space. This property is handy in languages such as German where two words can be combined to form a compound word (e.g. liederhosen). For example, the words in the Example column would not be spelling errors if this property were set to True.

CheckCompoundWords

| pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinspellchecker{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinspellchecker.spelloptions~checkhyphenatedtext.html[CheckHyphenatedText]"] 
|True
|WinSpellChecker looks at each part of the hyphenated word to determine if there is a spelling error. Setting this property to False will force WinSpellChecker to check for the entire hyphenated word in the dictionary, not the separate parts. For example, the words in the Example column will all be spelling errors if this property is set to False; even though the separate words are spelled correctly.
