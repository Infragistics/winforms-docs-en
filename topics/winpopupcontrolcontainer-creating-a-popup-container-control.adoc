= Creating a Pop-up Container Control

The WinPopupControlContainer™ gives you an effective way to conserve screen real estate while providing functionality to your users. You can use this component to represent a portion of your application's interface in a single control, such as a command button. When the user clicks the button, a container opens presenting the controls that make up the interface. Common uses for pop-up container controls might include a custom list view, a table-based interface or a selection of graphical options.

WinPopupControlContainer displays no user interface at design-time. You assign the control you want to appear as the pop-up control, using the PopupControl property.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
This control can be a form or a container control such as a Panel that contains other controls.
====

At run time, you invoke the Show method of the element to display its contents at the current mouse position or at a specified point.

[start=1]
. Double-click the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultrapopupcontrolcontainer.html[UltraPopupControlContainer]"]  component in the Visual Studio toolbox. The component will be added to the component tray area of the current form.
[start=2]
. Add the control that you want to appear as a pop-up, or verify that it already exists on the form. This can be a container control, such as a Panel, that contains other controls. It can even be the form itself.
[start=3]
. Select the UltraPopupControlContainer component and in the properties grid locate the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultrapopupcontrolcontainer~popupcontrol.html[PopupControl]"]  property. Select from the drop-down list the control that will serve as the pop-up container.
[start=4]
. Add the control to the form that will be used to display the pop-up container. Typically, this will be a button control.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
That if you have selected the form itself as the pop-up container, you must place the UI for displaying the pop-up on a different form, and alter your code as needed to account for cross-form references.
====

[start=5]
. Add the following code to the Click event of the button (or other control) that will display the pop-up:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub btnShowTree_Click(ByVal sender As Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnShowTree.Click
	Me.UltraPopupControlContainer1.Show()
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

----
private void btnShowTree_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	this.ultraPopupControlContainer1.Show();
}
----

[start=6]
. Build and run the project. You will see that the control you have specified as the pop-up is hidden when the form is displayed. Clicking the button displays the pop-up control at the current position of the mouse. If you used a container control for the pop-up, you can click on any of the controls it contains, or anywhere inside the container, and the pop-up remains on screen. Click outside of the pop-up control, and it is dismissed.
