= Custom Layers Can Be Added to Composite Charts

The 2006 Volume 2 release exposes its layering architecture (in which each layer is pressed on top of each other into a final chart) to Composite charts. In addition to standard (non-composite charts), you now have the power and flexibility to add and remove custom chart layers to/from Composite charts.
