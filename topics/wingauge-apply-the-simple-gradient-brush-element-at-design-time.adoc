= Apply the Simple Gradient Brush Element at Design Time

If you want a property of your gauge to start with one color and fade into another color in a specific way, apply the Simple Gradient brush element to the property.

*To apply a Simple Gradient brush element to a property of your gauge at design time:*

[start=1]
. Add a Radial Gauge to the Gauges collection.
[start=2]
. In the left-hand pane of the Gauges collection editor, click Radial Gauge.
[start=3]
. Expand the   pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgauge~dial.html[Dial]"]  property.
[start=4]
. From the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.gauge~brushelement.html[BrushElement]"]  drop-down list, select Simple Gradient. This will create a new Simple Gradient brush element.
[start=5]
. Expand the newly created BrushElement property, and set the following properties:

** StartColor - Click the drop-down arrow. The color picker appears. On the top, click Web, then select the Firebrick color.
** End Color - Click the drop-down arrow. The color picker appears. On the top, click Web, then select the Black color.
