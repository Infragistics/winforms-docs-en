= Configure a Context Menu at Design Time

There are two ways to add and remove tools from a  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.popupmenutool.html[PopupMenuTool]"]  from within the customize dialog at design time. If the tool is on a toolbar then you may simply click on the tool to drop it down and then either click on the "[Insert New Tool]" placeholder or right click on a tool already on the menu and open the "Insert Tools" submenu. The alternative is to use the PopupMenuTool Designer of the customize dialog.
