= WinTimelineView Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005/2008 (.NET Framework 2.0/3.5), each Infragistics Windows Forms control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By simply selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WinTimelineView™ Smart Tag contains the name of the component, as well as the following items:

* *Appearance:* Provides common tasks involving the appearance, look, and feel of the control.
* *Data:* Refers to any underlying data the control is using such as data sources and data members.
* *Date/Time Interval:* Refers to the Timeslot settings required by the control that is displayed along a horizontal timeline.
* *Layout:* Offers properties that will determine where and how the control is placed on the form.
* *Owners:* Refers to how Owners are grouped.

See below for a description of the above mentioned items, as well as the item's corresponding property in the properties grid.
