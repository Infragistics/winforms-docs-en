= Manually Creating ColumnSets using the Designer

*Before You Begin*

WinTree™ supports displaying Columns of data which is possible by either binding to a data source or by manually adding columns. Either way, ColumnSets are created. To know more about ColumnSets refer to the link:wintree-wintree-columnsets-overview.html[WinTree ColumnSets Overview] topic. The WinTree control can have different ColumnSets on each parent node allowing it to show heterogeneous data. For example, the first Tree Node can represent a Customer schema, the second Tree Node can represent an Employee schema and so on.

*What you will Accomplish*

In this topic you will learn how to create columns and nodes using the WinTree designer.

*Follow these Steps** From the Microsoft® Visual Studio® Toolbox, drag and drop an UltraTree onto your form.
* Click the WinTree smart tag and select Edit ColumnSets. The UltraTreeColumnSet Collection Editor dialog appears.
* Click the Add button to create a new UltraTreeColumnSet. The New UltraTreeColumnSet dialog window appears.
* Enter a meaningful name for the Key property, in this case Customers_ColumnSet. This is the name given to the ColumnSet.

* Click Ok.
* In the ColumnSet’s property section, under the Behavior node select  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintree.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratreecolumnset~columns.html[Columns]"]  property. Click the ellipsis… button.

* The UltraTreeNodeColumn Collection Editor dialog window appears. The columns that need to be added to the ColumnSet are configured here. Click the Add button. A default column with Key “Column 1” is created.
* Set the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.shared.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.shared.keyedsubobjectbase~key.html[Key]"]  and Text property of the column to “FirstName”. Also change the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintree.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratreenodecolumn~datatype.html[DataType]"]  to System.String.
* Repeat the above steps 7 & 8 to add three more columns (LastName, ContactTitle, and Address) to the Customer_ColumnSet and assign the respective Key and Text properties.

* Click Ok in the UltraTreeNodeColumn Collection Editor and UltraTreeColumnSet Collection Editor dialog windows.
* In the WinTree control’s smart tag select Edit Nodes. The UltraWinTree Node Editor dialog appears.
* Click the Add Root button to add one node with the Key and Text properties set to “Customers”.

* Locate and expand the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintree.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.override.html[Override]"]  property and then locate the ColumnSet property and select “Customers_ColumnSet” that is listed in the drop-down.

* Click Ok.
* Click the smart tag on WinTree and set the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintree.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratree~viewstyle.html[ViewStyle]"]  to FreeForm. Now your WinTree should look like the following screenshot with the ColumnSet arrangement.

* Add cell values to all the columns added to the ColumnSet.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.ultraTree1.Nodes["Customers"].Cells["FirstName"].Value = "Bill"
Me.ultraTree1.Nodes["Customers"].Cells["LastName"].Value = "Smith"
Me.ultraTree1.Nodes["Customers"].Cells["ContactTitle"].Value = "Mr"
Me.ultraTree1.Nodes["Customers"].Cells["Address"].Value = "59, Lackland Ave, Camden, New jersey"
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraTree1.Nodes["Customers"].Cells["FirstName"].Value = "Bill";
this.ultraTree1.Nodes["Customers"].Cells["LastName"].Value = "Smith";
this.ultraTree1.Nodes["Customers"].Cells["ContactTitle"].Value = "Mr";
this.ultraTree1.Nodes["Customers"].Cells["Address"].Value = "59, Lackland Ave, Camden, New jersey";
----

* Run the application. The form should look similar to the following screenshot.
