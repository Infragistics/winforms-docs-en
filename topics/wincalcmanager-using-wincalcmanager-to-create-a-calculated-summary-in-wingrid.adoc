= Using WinCalcManager to Create a Calculated Summary in WinGrid

== Before You Begin:

In this walk through you will create a calculated summary in a WinGrid™ column footer using a formula. The summary will show a grand total of the "Item Total" column in the grid. This walk through builds off the link:wincalcmanager-creating-a-calculated-column-in-wingrid.html[Creating a Calculated Column in WinGrid] and link:wincalcmanager-using-wincalcmanager-to-create-running-totals-in-wingrid.html[Using WinCalcManager to Create Running Totals in WinGrid] topics.

== Follow These Steps:

[start=1]
. Add summary information to the grid column footers.

Right-click the WinGrid and select "UltraGrid Designer" to launch the grid designer.

In the grid designer, drill down to the node: "Band and Column Settings> Band[0] - 'Order Details'."

In the properties grid on the right scroll down to where the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridband~summaries.html[Summaries]"]  collection is located.

[start=2]
. Click the ellipse to open up the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.summaryvalue~summarysettings.html[SummarySettings]"]  collection editor. With the editor open click the add Button to add a new SummarySettings.

. Set in the properties grid on the SummarySettings the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.summarysettings~summaryposition.html[SummaryPosition]"]  to Right and the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridcolumn~formula.html[Formula]"]  property to the following formula.
