= Title Text Property Defaults to Empty String

Previously, customers have reported confusion about the titles of the chart (e.g., "Copyright Infragistics" or "Infragistics UltraChart"). It is often assumed that these titles indicate that the chart is unlicensed, and that the titles will disappear after registering the project. To avoid any confusion, the default value of the title's text property is now an empty string.
