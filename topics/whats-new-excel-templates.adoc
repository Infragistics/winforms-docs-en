= Excel Templates

In this release we have added support for Excel Template file formats within our Infragistics Excel library. You can now save and load files with Excel Template format (with extensions XLTX), the Excel Macro-enabled Template format (with extension XLTM), and the Excel 97-2003 Template format (with extension XLT). For this purpose three new values (Excel2007Template, Excel2007MacroEnabledTemplate, and Excel97To2003Template) have been added to the Infragistics.Documents.Excel.WorkbookFormat enumeration.
