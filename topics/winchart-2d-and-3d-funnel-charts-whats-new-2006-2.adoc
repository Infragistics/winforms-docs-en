= 2D and 3D Funnel Charts

The 2D and 3D Funnel charts are a valued addition to our suite of charts in the 2006 Volume 2 release. The Funnel chart offers a powerful means of predictive data analysis (e.g., projecting future sales or displaying current sales). Each funnel slice represents a part of the whole.
