= Using WinCalcManager in the DataGridView

In Visual Studio 2003 (.NET Framework 1.1) and earlier, the WinCalcManager™ was not supported within Microsoft's in-box DataGrid control. However, in Visual Studio 2005 (.NET Framework 2.0), the WinCalcManager is fully supported within the DataGridView control.
