= Extended the Swap Rows and Columns Feature

Until now, the ability to swap row and column data (i.e., rows of a data table becoming columns, and columns of the data table becoming rows) was available only to charts bound to a data table via the default data binding mechanism.

Starting in the 2006 Volume 2 release, you can now swap row and column data for composite and non-composite charts that are bound to series data objects. Enabling a simple property ( pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.dataappearance~swaprowsandcolumns.html[SwapRowsAndColumns]"] ) can save you from the manual effort of having to shape your chart data to suit your needs.
