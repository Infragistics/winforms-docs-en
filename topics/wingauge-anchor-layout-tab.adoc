= Anchor Layout Tab

The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugeneedle~anchor.html[Anchor]"]  property of the WinGauge control is used in connection with the Needle  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingauge{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugescale~markers.html[Marker]"]  property. An anchor is placed on the center of your Radial gauge so that you can use the anchor as the rotation point of the needle marker.

You can style the anchor on your gauge using the Anchor Layout tab of the Properties panel. You can access this tab by either clicking Anchor in the Gauge Explorer (Radial Gauge > Scales > Markers > Needle > Anchor) or clicking the anchor of your Radial gauge in the interactive preview area.

The tab is divided into three panes:

* link:wingauge-extent-pane.html[Extent]
* link:wingauge-radius-pane.html[Radius]
* link:wingauge-spoke-pane.html[Spoke]
