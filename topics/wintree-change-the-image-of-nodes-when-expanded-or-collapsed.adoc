= Change the Image of Nodes When Expanded or Collapsed

This topic will describe how to have nodes in a WinTree™ that show an image, and make that image change when the node is Expanded.

This can be done with or without an ImageList control.

[start=1]
. Add an ImageList to your form, and add at least two images to it. For the purposes of simplicity, the collapsed image will be referred to as image 0 and the expanded image will be image 1.
[start=2]
. Then, you need to attach the ImageList to the UltraTree.

To do this, select the UltraTree control on the form, and find the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintree.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratree~imagelist.html[ImageList]"]  Property.

Drop down the list and choose the appropriate ImageList control.
[start=3]
. Go to the Load event of the Form.
[start=4]
. This code will set the image of every node in the tree. This will be the collapsed image.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.UltraTree1.Override.NodeAppearance.Image = 0
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraTree1.Override.NodeAppearance.Image = 0;
----

[start=5]
. Next, you must apply the expanded image to the nodes. You can do this by using the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintree.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.override~expandednodeappearance.html[ExpandedNodeAppeance]"]  of the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawintree.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.override.html[Override]"] .

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.UltraTree1.Override.ExpandedNodeAppearance.Image = 1
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraTree1.Override.ExpandedNodeAppearance.Image = 1;
----

[start=6]
. Run the program.
[start=7]
. All the nodes in the UltraTree will show the collapsed image by default.
[start=8]
. If any nodes are expanded, they will show the expanded image.
[start=9]
. Expand a node and the node's image will change to the expanded image.
[start=10]
. Collapse a node and it will show the collapsed image.
