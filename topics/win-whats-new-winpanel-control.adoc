= New WinPanel Control

The WinPanel™ control is an addition to the list of Infragistics Windows Forms controls. The WinPanel control comes with the flexibility of styling introduced by the Presentation Layer Framework™ as well as the features of the .Net Panel control, such as scrolling and auto-sizing. Up until now, you were limited to use the InboxControlStyler™ with a .Net Panel control, that had limited ability to control the appearance of the Panel.

Since WinPanel is derived from UltraControl,  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.appearance.html[Appearance]"]  based styling can be applied to its background and scrollbars as well.
