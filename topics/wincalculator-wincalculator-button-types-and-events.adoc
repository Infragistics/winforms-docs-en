= WinCalculator Button Types and Events

The following is the list of Settings available for any WinCalculator™ and WinCalculatorDropDown™ button's Type property and the events they fire.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Type Of Button|Description|Events Fired

|Numeric Button
|A standard Numeric Button such as 3, 6, 8.
|BeforeButtonClicked

|ActionButton
|Acts as a Standard button on the calculator that can perform actions but does not effect the display in any way. For example, MC, CE or C Buttons
|BeforeButtonClicked 

BeforeActionButtonPressed 

AfterActionButtonPressed

|Operator
|Acts as an operator, such as +, -, /. Will clear the display once the next numeric key is pressed.
|BeforeButtonClicked 

BeforeCalculatePending 

AfterCalculatePending

|OperatorImmediateAction
|Performs a calculation immediately and is not entered into the queue and does not clear the other operators either. The square root button would be an example.
|BeforeButtonClicked 

BeforeCalculateImmediate 

AfterCalculateImmediate

|OperatorPerformImmediateThenPendingCalculations
|Performs a calculation immediately, the same as the OperatorImmediateAction but then also performs any remaining operations. For example, the % key. An example of how this is different from OperatorImmediateAction would be when using the square root button and another operator, the following buttons would need to be pressed to find a result: 

[source]
---- 
12 * 9Sqrt =
---- 

 (would produce 36) 

While to find 10% of 12 you would only have to press: 

[source]
---- 
12 * 10%
---- 

 (would produce 1.2, no *=* key required) 

The % key is an OperatorPerformImmediateThenPendingCalculations key, so after it is pressed it performs all waiting operations.
|BeforeButtonClicked 

BeforeCalculateImmediate 

AfterCalculateImmediate 

BeforeCalculatePending 

AfterCalculatePending

|OperatorPerformPendingCalculations
|Performs pending operations such as the = key
|BeforeButtonClicked BeforeCalculatePending AfterCalculatePending
