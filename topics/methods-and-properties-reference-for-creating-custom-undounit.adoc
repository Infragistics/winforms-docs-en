== Methods and Properties Reference for Creating Custom UndoUnit

[[_Ref321150208]]

=== Introduction

The link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undounit_members.html[UndoUnit] is an abstract base class that is used to undo/redo changes.

If you need to support undo/redo of specific type of changes, you need to create a custom `UndoUnit`. The class exposes several abstract members listed below.

=== Methods reference summary

The following table summarizes the purpose and functionality of the methods exposed by the `UndoUnit` class.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Method|Description

|`Execute`
|Used to perform the undo/redo operation for the change. 

The method takes link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undoexecutecontext_members.html[UndoExecuteContext] object as a parameter. This parameter provides information about: 

* the type of operation being performed (for example - Undo, Redo, Rollback) 

* The reference to the `UndoManager` for which the operation is being performed. 

.Note: 

[NOTE] 

==== 

During an Undo/Redo operation, the object will be removed from the Undo/Redo stack and will not automatically be put onto the alternate stack. 

It is assumed that the changes made by the UndoUnit will result in operations being added to the undo/redo stack by invoking the AddChange method (directly or indirectly via helper methods). 

If the object being manipulated is not responsible for doing this, the custom UndoUnit could handle this itself.

| link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undounit~getdescription.html[GetDescription]
|Returns a string description of the type of change. 

The method takes two parameters: 

* an link:{ApiPlatform}undo{ApiVersion}~infragistics.undo.undohistoryitemtype.html[UndoHistoryItemType] – to indicate from which history a description is required 

* a boolean value to specify if a detailed description is needed. 

|`Merge`
|Used to provide custom support for merging `UndoUnits`.
