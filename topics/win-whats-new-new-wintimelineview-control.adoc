= New WinTimelineView Control

A new WinTimelineView™ control has been added to Infragistics Windows Forms suite of controls, which display  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinschedule.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.timeslot.html[TimeSlots]"]  and  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinschedule.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinschedule.appointment.html[Appointments]"]  along a horizontal timeline from left to right. With this control you can span time across different intervals: minutes or hours, and span dates across different date intervals: days, weeks, months, or years.

The WinTimelineView control supports all the key functionalities of the existing WinSchedule controls. It is also similar to the graphical representation of the WinDayView™ control but with a difference in positioning of Owners and TimeSlots. WinTimelineView represents Owners as rows and TimeSlots as columns, whereas WinDayView represents Owners as columns and TimeSlots as rows.
