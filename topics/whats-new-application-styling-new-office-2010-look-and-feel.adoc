= New Office 2010 Look and Feel

With this release of Infragistics Windows Forms, your application can get the new Microsoft® Office 2010 look and feel. A new Office2010Blue StyleSet has been added to our Style Library. You can take advantage of this new style by loading the StyleSet (isl file) into your application, using the link:{ApiPlatform}win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.appstyling.stylemanager~load.html[Load] method of the link:{ApiPlatform}win.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.appstyling.stylemanager.html[StyleManager] class. Now your entire application can take advantage of this new style.
