= Grouping Rows by Custom Logic Using IGroupByEvaluator

== Before you Begin

There are different ways of grouping records of a band by a column. The GroupByMode property allows you to select one of several predefined Outlook Group By behaviors by which you can group your data by. It is possible that you might have to group the Grid rows using some custom logic that is above and beyond just setting the GroupByMode property. The  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.igroupbyevaluator.html[IGroupByEvaluator]"] Interface can be used to supply custom logic for grouping rows whenever none of the GroupByMode values meet your needs. Also if sorting of the rows is not consistent with the grouping criteria, you will need to implement the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.igroupbyevaluatorex.html[IGroupByEvaluatorEx]"]  Interface.

== What You Will Accomplish

In this walkthrough you will learn how to group rows using a custom logic by implementing the IGroupByEvaluator interface. You will also implement the IGroupByEvaluatorEx Interface in order to perform sorting that is not consistent with the grouping order. For this sample, the grouping is based on the last two characters of the ProductName column and then sorted by first two characters(Descending ordering) of the ProductName column. Understanding how these interfaces are implemented through this walkthrough will allow you to create more advanced and custom implementations to suit your specific needs.

== Follow these Steps

. Before you start writing any code, you should place using/imports directives in your code-behind so you don't need to always type out a member's fully qualified name.
+
*In Visual Basic:*
[source, vb]
Imports Infragistics.Win
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid
+
*In C#:*
[source, csharp]
using Infragistics.Win;
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid;

. Drag an UltraGrid™ from the Visual Studio® Toolbox and drop it on to your form. Bind the UltraGrid control to Products table of the Northwind Database. For more information on binding WinGrid™ to a datasource, link:wingrid-binding-wingrid-to-a-flat-data-source-clr2.html[Bind WinGrid to a Flat Data Source] Topic.

. Add an UltraButton™ to the form.

. Create a class file named MyGroupByEvaluator that implements IGroupByEvaluator and IGroupByEvaluatorEx interface. This class contains code that implements  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.igroupbyevaluator~getgroupbyvalue.html[GetGroupByValue]"]  and  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.igroupbyevaluator~doesgroupcontainrow.html[DoesGroupContainRow]"]  methods that are member of the IGroupByEvaluator interface and also  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.igroupbyevaluatorex~compare.html[Compare]"]  method that is a member of IGroupByEvaluatorEx interface. Write the following code within MyGroupByEvaluator class.

[source, vb]
