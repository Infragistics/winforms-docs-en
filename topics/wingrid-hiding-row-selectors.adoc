= Hiding Row Selectors

== To hide row selectors:

[start=1]
. Before you start writing any code, you should place using/imports directives in your code-behind so you don't need to always type out a member's fully qualified name.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Win
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win;
----

[start=2]
. The following code demonstrates how to hide the row selectors in the WinGrid™ control.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub HidingRowSelectors_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
	Me.UltraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Override.RowSelectors = DefaultableBoolean.False
End Sub
----

*In C#:*

----
private void HidingRowSelectors_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	this.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Override.RowSelectors = DefaultableBoolean.False;
}
----

[start=3]
. Here is a snapshot of two grids, the first with row selectors and the second without them.
