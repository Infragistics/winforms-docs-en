= Added Box Chart

Our WinChart™ suite now includes the link:chart-about-box-charts.html[Box Chart] (also known as the "box-and-whisker chart" and the "box plot"). This new chart type is one of the more advanced chart types when it comes to handling statistical data, and is especially useful when you need to compare two or more sets of data.

The Box Chart provides a visual snapshot of the distribution of data based on key values from summary statistics. Usually, the Box Chart is based on five statistics: the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and the maximum.

With the Box Chart, you can easily quickly obtain valuable information about the data set such as the shape of the distribution, and where the median of the distribution lies. Furthermore, if the median is far from the center of the box, or if one of the whiskers (the small lines to the left and right of the box) is far longer than the other, you can determine that the distribution is somewhat skewed.
