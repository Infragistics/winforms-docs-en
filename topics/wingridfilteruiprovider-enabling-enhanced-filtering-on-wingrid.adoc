= Enabling Enhanced Filtering on WinGrid

WinGrid™ offers Enhanced filtering as a means of controlling what data is displayed by the end-user. This functionality includes filtering by specific data-types, such as string operations (begins-with, contains, etc), date operations (between dates, before today’s date, etc), or providing the ability to filter by selecting multiple values that appear in a column using a checkbox.

In order to enable the advanced filtering UI on the WinGrid control that mimics the functionality provided by Excel2007, the following three steps need to be performed.

[start=1]
. Drag and drop the ultraGridFilterUIProvider™ component from the Visual Studio® toolbox on to your Form.
[start=2]
. Set the WinGrid control’s  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridoverride~filteruiprovider.html[FilterUIProvider]"]  property to the ultraGridFilterUIProvider you placed on the Form.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Override.FilterUIProvider = Me.ultraGridFilterUIProvider1
'This can be set for each Band as well:
'Me.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Bands(0).Override.FilterUIProvider = Me.ultraGridFilterUIProvider1
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Override.FilterUIProvider = this.ultraGridFilterUIProvider1;
//This can be set on each Band as well:
//this.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Override.FilterUIProvider = this.ultraGridFilterUIProvider1;
----

[start=3]
. Set the  pick:[win-forms="link:infragistics4.win.ultrawingrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridoverride~allowrowfiltering.html[AllowRowFiltering]"]  property to true.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Override.AllowRowFiltering = Infragistics.Win.DefaultableBoolean.True
----

*In C#:*

----
this.ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Override.AllowRowFiltering = Infragistics.Win.DefaultableBoolean.True;
----

Now data in the WinGrid can be filtered using the advanced Filtering options:

The following screenshot shows a WinGrid populated with the Orders table of the Northwind database. A text filter for the CustomerID column is shown below. You can filter by selecting the checkboxes or by selecting from the context menu and then entering a filter criterion. Pressing the Ok button will filter the Grid rows.
