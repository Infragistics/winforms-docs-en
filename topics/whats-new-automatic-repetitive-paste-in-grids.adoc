= Automatic Repetitive Paste in Grids

Starting with 2011 Volume 2 of Infragistics Windows Forms, users can paste a selection of cells multiple times with a single paste operation. They can do this by selecting a destination area that is an exact multiple of the copied area. Thus the user paste functionality, as provided by the WinGrid™ control, is exactly the same as when pasting in Microsoft Excel®.
