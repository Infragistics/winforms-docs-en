= Applying Appearances to WinCalculatorDropDown

An object's Appearance determines how the object is displayed. Most objects can have their  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.appearance.html[Appearance]"]  properties change to provide complete control over an object's look.

== Setting Appearances at Design-Time

To change the Appearance of the entire WinCalculatorDropDown™ control, expand the Appearance property on the property page and make the desired changes to its sub-properties. These changes apply to the entire element and any Appearance that has not been overridden by the ButtonAppearance property or individual button Appearances.

To change the Appearance of the Buttons group as a whole, expand the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawineditors{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawineditors.ultrawincalc.ultracalculatordropdown~calculatorbuttonappearance.html[CalculatorButtonAppearance]"]  property on the property page and make the desired changes to its sub-properties. These changes will affect the properties for every button on the calculator that does not have an individual Appearance object.

To change the Appearance of individual buttons, expand the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawineditors{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawineditors.ultrawincalc.ultracalculatordropdown~buttons.html[Buttons]"]  property and then the Appearance for an individual button on the property page and make the desired changes to its sub-properties. These changes apply for an individual button, overriding all preceding appearances. Make sure you set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultracontrolbase~useosthemes.html[UseOsThemes]"]  property to False to see the appearance changes you have made take effect. In addition, if you application is using Application Styling you should set the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultracontrolbase~useappstyling.html[UseAppStyling]"]  property to False in order to see the changes you have made local on the control.

== Setting Appearances at Run-Time

The following example code shows how to change the different Appearances of the WinCalculatorDropDown at Run-Time:

*In Visual Basic:*
