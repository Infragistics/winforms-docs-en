= New WinFormManager Component

The new WinFormManager™ component enables you to style the areas of a form that typically cannot be styled such as the caption area, the form borders, and the close, restore, maximize, minimize and context help buttons. The form can be styled through the properties window and also via Infragistics very own AppStylist. By choosing the WinFormsManager component you will be able to get a consistent look for all the forms used in your application (e.g., you can configure the child forms using the new WinFormManager, and match the main form that has a WinToolbarsManager with an Office 2007 look).
