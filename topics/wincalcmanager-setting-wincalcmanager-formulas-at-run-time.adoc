= Setting WinCalcManager's Formulas at Run Time

You can interact with the WinCalcManager™ at run time by getting or setting any of the properties associated with the elements in a calculation network on a form. This walkthrough is designed to show you how to set up a summation of the values of two text boxes and put the resulting value in a third text box.

[start=1]
. Begin with a Windows Forms project.
[start=2]
. Before you start writing any code, you should place using/imports directives in your code-behind so you don't need to always type out a member's fully qualified name.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Win.UltraWinCalcManager
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Win.UltraWinCalcManager;
----

[start=3]
. On the form place an UltraCalcManager, three TextBoxes, and a server Button arrange them how you please.

[start=4]
. Create the Click event for the button you have placed on the form. Place the following code into newly created Click event.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub btnCalculate_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnCalculate.Click
	' Gets the CalcSettings for the extended element specified.
	Dim cs1 As CalcSettings = Me.UltraCalcManager1.GetCalcSettings(Me.txtNumber1)
	' Gets/sets which property of the control is used as either the source or target 
	' of any calculations involving the control.
	cs1.PropertyName = "Text"
	' This sets the CalcSettings extender property for the specified element.
	Me.UltraCalcManager1.SetCalcSettings(Me.txtNumber1, cs1)
	' Gets the CalcSettings for the extended element specified.
	Dim cs2 As CalcSettings = Me.UltraCalcManager1.GetCalcSettings(Me.txtNumber2)
	' Gets/sets which property of the control is used as either the source or target 
	' of any calculations involving the control.
	cs2.PropertyName = "Text"
	' This sets the CalcSettings extender property for the specified element. 
	Me.UltraCalcManager1.SetCalcSettings(Me.txtNumber2, cs2)
	' Gets the CalcSettings for the extended element specified.
	Dim cs3 As CalcSettings = Me.UltraCalcManager1.GetCalcSettings(Me.txtSum)
	' Gets/sets which property of the control is used as either the source or target 
	' of any calculations involving the control.
	cs3.PropertyName = "Text"
	' The Formula which will be used to set the value of this object. 
	cs3.Formula = "[//txtNumber1] + [//txtNumber2]"
	' This sets the CalcSettings extender property for the specified element. 
	Me.UltraCalcManager1.SetCalcSettings(Me.txtSum, cs3)
End Sub

. If you build project and run it, type in values into the first and second textbox, and press the Calculate button, the resulting calculation will display in the third textbox.
