= Bands and Hierarchical Data

Because the WinGrid™ is designed to display hierarchical data, the concept of data bands is built into the grid at every level. A band of data is equivalent to all the rows that are drawn from the same recordset, or alternatively, all the rows that appear at the same level of the data hierarchy. Even when displaying a flat (non-hierarchical) recordset, the WinGrid still uses the band structure (a flat recordset simply appears in a single band).

Each band, which contains rows, represents one level of the hierarchy in a hierarchical recordset. Many of the objects that correspond to visible parts of the grid (e.g., columns and headers) are not accessed directly from the element level, but from the band level. So if you are trying to find an object, property or method that you think exists, but cannot locate it at the element level, try looking for the item as a sub-object, property or method of the  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridband.html[UltraGridBand]"]  object or its  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawingrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawingrid.ultragridoverride.html[UltraGridOverride]"]  object, provided by the Override property.

The following snapshot displays WinGrid with hierarchical data.
