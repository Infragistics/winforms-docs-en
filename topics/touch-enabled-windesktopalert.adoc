The state of the touch-enabled setting of the link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.touch.ultratouchprovider_members.html[UltraTouchProvider] is cached and used for the duration of the alert window. Toggling the `Enabled` property of the link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.touch.ultratouchprovider_members.html[UltraTouchProvider] will have no impact on already open alert windows.
