= About the Ribbon

The Ribbon is a unique user interface component that is so intuitive it can take as little as two mouse clicks to perform any task associated with the Ribbon. The first click involves a  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ribbontab.html[RibbonTab]"] . These tabs contain  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintoolbars.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintoolbars.ribbongroup.html[RibbonGroups]"] , which in turn contain tools. You may already be familiar with these tools as they are the same tools used in WinToolbarsManager™. Once the end-user clicks the proper tab, they only need to click the tool that they want to use in any of the groups in the tab. The Ribbon is different from a standard toolbar in that all toolbars and tools are readily available by clicking a tab. In order to meet this standard of readiness in a standard toolbar, you would need to have all toolbars with all tools viewable at the same time. This leads to a very cluttered user interface. The Ribbon cleans this disorganization by categorizing tools into groups, and groups into tabs.
