= Add Images to WinTree with Columns

This topic will show you how to add images to a WinTree™ with  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintree{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratreecolumnsettings~columnsets.html[ColumnSet(s)]"] ColumnSet(s) and has columns displayed. Images can be added using the Cell object’s  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintree{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratreenodecell~appearance.html[Appearance]"]  property. This is applicable for the WinTree control in any  pick:[win-forms="link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawintree{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawintree.ultratree~viewstyle.html[ViewStyle]"] .

Another approach to showing images is to add an unbound column to the ColumnSet for the sole purpose to display the Images.

This topic assumes there is an ImageList control dropped onto the form that has few sample images in it. Assign the ImageList control to the WinTree, through the ImageList property.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
'Assign the ImageList control to WinTree
 Me.ultraTree1.ImageList = this.imageList1
'Adding Image to a cell in WinTree by setting the index of the image in 'ImageList control.
Me.ultraTree1.Nodes(0).Cells(0).Appearance.Image = 1
----

*In C#:*

----
//Assign the ImageList control to WinTree
 this.ultraTree1.ImageList = this.imageList1;
//Adding Image to a cell in WinTree by setting the index of the image in //ImageList control.
this.ultraTree1.Nodes[0].Cells[0].Appearance.Image = 1;
----
